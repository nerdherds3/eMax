make it off this bridge.</i>

9
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:22,120
<i>Spider-Man attacked me.</i>

10
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,489
<i>He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.</i>

11
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:28,093
<i>He's saying he's gonna be
the new Iron Man. No one else.</i>

12

<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,397

- Yo, it's him.
- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,458
- Please don't touch her, sir.
- You're just a kid?

38
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,160
- You murdered Mysterio?
- Um...

39
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:36,662
- You helped him?
- No, I didn't...

40
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,831
Come on, kid,
let me see your face.

41
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,298
He hit me.
Spider-Man hit me!

42
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:41,968
- Come on.
- He hit me.

43
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,970
<i>All this time,

46
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:52,078
I told you I never wanted
to do this ever again!

47
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,013
MJ, I'm so sorry,
but I can't see anything

48
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,213
with your hand in my...

49
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:56,616
Sorry. Where are we
gonna go?

50
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,517
- I don't know. Your house?
- No! No!

51
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,118
My dad will kill you.

52
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,021
What? You said
your dad really liked me.

53
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,923
Yeah, well, not anymore.

54
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,694
<i>Dude!</i>

I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

59
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,334
No, not really. Uh...

60
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:17,903
Yo, Peter!

61
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,145
We should go.
We should go. Come on.

62
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,715
- You said you don't want to swing.
- Swing me.

63
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,449
Okay. We can take the subway.

64
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,122
No.

65
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:43,129
Look out!

66
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,139
That was so much worse.

67
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,339
Okay. It's okay.

68
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:57,409
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,478
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

70
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:13,059
Okay. Okay.

71
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:14,225
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,964
I just feel so dumb. I didn't
realize you were miserable.

73
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,766
No, it was really fun, right?

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,434
That's why they call it a fling.

75
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,003
- And we flung.
- It was fun.

76
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,504
I could've been more fun.

77
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,082
- I can be fun.
- We'll hang out again.

78
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,141
Like, when do you think?

79
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,778
I should see what that is.

80
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,780
- No, no, no.
- It's what I do.

81
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,916
- He's always coming and going.
- Peter?

82
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,484
Oh, no.

83
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,987
- I don't know what to do.
- Peter. Peter.

84
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,090
- Oh, I...
- I didn't see anything.

85
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,457
This isn't what it looks like.

86
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,258
- No, no, May.
- Practice safe...

87
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:50,096
Oh, hey. You must be MJ!

88
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:52,698
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

89
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,667
Wait, have you been crying?

90
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,901
We broke up.

91
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,304
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh. Oh, uh...

92
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,174
Thank you. I didn't know
you broke up.

93
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:03,576
I thought you were in love, May.

94
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,211
Can we talk about this
in the kitchen?

95
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:06,846
I should probably leave.

96
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,881
I thought you guys
were such a handsome couple.

97
00:04:09,014 --> 00:04:11,050
It's really about boundaries.

98
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,451
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go here.

99
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,066
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

100
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,056
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

101
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,126
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

102
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,194
This has nothing to do with sex.

103
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,664
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean... What's that sound?

104
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,400
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

105
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,437
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

106
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,174
You take care of your
side, I'll take care of mine.

107
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:39,044
What is up with this phone?

108
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,046
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

109
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,414
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

110
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,549
Peter?

111
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
What?

112
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,591
- Is that...?
- Is that here?

113
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,126
Um...

114
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,175
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

115
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:11,210
Maybe it's not such a big deal.

Get in here, guys. Let's go.

139
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,863
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

140
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,798
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

141
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,167
Well, look. Nick Fury was there
the entire time.

142
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,102
Ask him.
He can explain everything.

143
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,972
Nick Fury has been off-planet

144
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:15,307
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

145
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,977
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

146
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,646
Don't say anything
without a lawyer.

147
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,480
I want a lawyer.

148
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,450
- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

149
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,853
Ms. Jones, why do you
want a lawyer if...?

150
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,188
If I have nothing to hide?

151
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,689
Exactly. Unless...

152
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,625
- I'm actually guilty of something?
- Mm-hm.

153
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,294
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

154
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:37,229
Just answer my questions.

155
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,031
I've seen your file.

156
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,366
You're a smart young woman

157
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,534
with a bright future
ahead of her.

158
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,169
Why would you risk it all

159
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,438
by getting involved with
a vigilante like Peter Parker?

160
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:50,542
So sorry to keep you waiting.

161
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,196
- Can we get Ned a snack?
- Absolutely.

162
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,646
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

163
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,848
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

164
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:58,050
I'm not supposed
to say anything to you.

165
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,185
Not even a thing.
I just have one question.

166
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,588
When MJ told you
Peter was Spider-Man...

167
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,422
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heh.
- What's up?

168
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:05,925
I-I knew way before MJ did.

169
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,502
I was Spider-Man's
"guy in the chair."

170
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:08,727
I know about those.

171
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,529
Dude, half my guys
are guys in the chair.

172
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,931
Exactly. You would know.

173
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,300
I literally helped him
find the Vulture.

174
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,702
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

175
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,237
and helped him get to space.

176
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,739
So in Spider-Man's
illegal vigilantism,

177
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,875
you were his main accomplice.

178
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,514
I would like to have my words
stricken from the record.

179
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:32,151
With all due respect, and
I mean that very insincerely,

180
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:35,287
unless you have some real
specific charges to throw at us,

181
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,057
legally, you can't hold us here.

182
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,526
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

183
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,728
Child endangerment's
a nasty rap.

184
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,596
A boy was entrusted to you,

185
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,066
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

186
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,335
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself,

187
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,103
but you actually encouraged it.

188
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:52,871
Who does that?

189
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,940
I wanna see Peter right now.

190
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,776
<i>Stark

191
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,446

192
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,048

193
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,884
<i>into missing Stark technology.</i>

194

<i>Agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...</i>

195
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,255
At least they used
a good picture.

196
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,157
What is happening?

197
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,862
That's great. Thank you.

198
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,564
Well, I have
some good news, Peter.

199
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,065
I don't believe
any of the charges

200
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,119
- against you are gonna stick.
- Wait, seriously?

201
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,702
- I knew it.
- Nice.

202
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,371
My God, Mr. Murdock, thank you.

203
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,139
- Thank you, Matt.
- That's amazing.

204
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,352
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

205
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,476
- However, Mr. Hogan.
- Yes?

206
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:33,779
The feds are investigating
that missing technology.

207
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:36,181
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

208
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,649
but if you were involved...

209
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,518
- If I was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

210
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:42,488
I need a lawyer because I'm...?
I thought he was...

211
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,922
You said there's no charge.

212
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,858
I could say
under advisement of counsel,

213
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,027
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

214
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,129
because the answer
can incriminate me...

215
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:52,631
It's in <i>Goodfellas.</i> What's the
thing they say in <i>Goodfellas?</i>

216
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,433
I know that's what you think.
Calm down.

217
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,968
Let's hear what
he has to say. Matt?

218
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,704
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer.

219
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,806
You may have dodged
your legal troubles

220
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,374
but things will get much worse.

221
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,843
There is still
the court of public opinion.

222
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,481
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

223
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,318
How did you just do that?

224
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,254
I'm a really good lawyer.

225
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,691
We're gonna need
a safer place to live.

226
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,104
Oh. Ah.

227
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,006
How do we...?
How do we...?

228

<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

229
00:09:38,777 --> 00:09:41,580

239
00:10:06,638 --> 00:10:08,674
Oh, Happy.

<i>Did you send in

241
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,411

- <i>You?</i>
- Same.

243
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,215
Can you imagine if
we both got in? And Ned?

244
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,868
Yeah, but we'd have
to get scholarships

245
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,384
so we could actually go.

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,720
You got the scores
and the grades.

247
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,255
<i>You think I'm being
too pragmatic.</i>

248
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,525
<i>No, no, no. Well...</i>

249
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:26,892
<i>Kind of. It's okay.</i>

250
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,625
It's one of my favorite
things about you.

251
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:29,928
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

252
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,897
What are your other
favorite things?

253
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,732
I love your relentless optimism.

254
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,901
I am a glass-half-full
kind of gal.

255
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,903
I really like how
you're a people person.

256
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:40,305
I love people.
I love them so much.

257
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:41,439
You like sports.

00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:45,944
What's that noise?

261
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,714
<i>Oh. It's Happy. Look.</i>

262
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,717
<i>Gave his room to May
so he's sleeping down here.</i>

263
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,757
I have a weird question. Um...

264
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,561
Does any part of you
feel relieved about all of this?

265
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,568
Ever since I got bit
by that spider...

266
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,938
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

267
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,307
Or kind of normal, I guess.

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,475
And...

269
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:19,278
that was when you found out.

270
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,047
<i>Because then everyone
that was in my life</i>

271
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,982
<i>that I wanted to know, knew.</i>

272
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,117
<i>And it was perfect.</i>

273
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,620
But now everybody knows and...

274
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,592
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

275
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,294

<i>Yeah. Me too.</i>

Wrap it up.

280
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,975
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

Stop. You're

Can we just stay up here

00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,722
- It is so crazy down there.

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:47,219
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

347
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,955
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

348
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:53,024
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes.

349
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,861
Minus the Frisbee
and the smiling.

350
00:14:54,993 --> 00:14:56,796
MIT's obviously the dream,

351
00:14:56,928 --> 00:14:58,798
but if we match up
our backup schools,

352
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,066
then either way,
we'll be in Boston.

353
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,168
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

354
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:05,404
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

355
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,206
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

356
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,677
What's up?

357
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,413
I don't know. I just feel
like, if you don't...

358
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,381
If you expect disappointment,

359
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,718
then you can never really
get disappointed.

360
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,285
Come on.

361
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,690
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

362
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,460
Yeah. No, you're right.
Fresh start.

363
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,629
Yeah.

364
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,866
Fresh start.

365
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,469
First one's here!

366
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,810
It's okay.
It's a backup school.

367
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,144
Peter!

368
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,381
No?

369
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,018
Last one.

370
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,755
MIT?

371
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,426
Uh... Okay.

372
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,372
Okay.

373
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,942
- Phew.
- Ready?

374
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,211
Jones. I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

375
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,947
Actually, that was Sasha so...

376
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,882
Enough attitude.
Just do it.

377
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:24,917
On it.

378
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,520
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

379
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,222
Don't, because he will
just make me clean it.

380
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:32,892
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

381
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,060
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You guys ready?

382
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,697
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

383
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,700
One, two, three.

384
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,424
No.

385
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,193
You?

386
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,362
"In light of recent controversy,

387
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:15,601
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

388
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,168
This is so not fair.

389
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,939
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

390
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,107
You guys definitely
didn't do anything wrong.

391
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,945
Expect disappointment and
you will never get disappointed.

392
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,247
♪ No sleep till ♪

393
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,786
♪ Boston ♪

394
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,026
You guys didn't get in?

395
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:42,828
Yeah, because we're actually
friends with Spider-Man.

396
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,165
Uh, yeah. I better get going.

397
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,302
There's a mixer
for new admissions and...

398
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,304
Sorry, guys.

399
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,205
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

400
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,841
Yeah, I'm coming.

401
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,009
Know what?

402
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,580
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

403
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,315
Me neither.

404
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,888
Although I do need to show
this letter to my parents.

405
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,559
Um, hi.

406
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,730
Hi?

407
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,232
I'm, uh...

408
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,401
The most famous person
in the world.

409
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,569
I know.

410
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,371
Wong. Try not to slip.

411
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,206
We don't have
liability insurance.

412
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,211
Is all this for a holiday party?

413
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:44,315
No. One of the rotunda
gateways connects to Siberia.

414
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,217
A blizzard blasted through.

415
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,790
Because someone forgot to cast
a monthly maintenance spell

416
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,290
to keep the seals tight.

417
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,259
That's right, he did,
because he forgot

418
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:56,662
- I now have higher duties.
- Higher duties?

419
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,998
The Sorcerer Supreme
has higher duties. Yes.

420
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,266
Wait, I thought you were
the Sorcerer Supreme.

421
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,968
No, he got it on a technicality

422
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:04,637
because I blipped
for five years.

423
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,640
- Oh, well, congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then...

424
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,874
You'd burn the place down.

425
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,309
You two, no one said
stop shoveling.

426
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,513
So, Peter, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

427
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,650
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

428
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,852
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

429
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,854
Think we're beyond
you calling me "sir."

430
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,522
Okay, uh, Stephen.

431
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,524
That feels weird,
but I'll allow it.

432
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,762
When...

433
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,832
When Mysterio
revealed my identity...

434
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,502
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering...

435
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,504
I don't know
if this would actually work,

436
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,006
but I was wondering if...

437
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,810
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

438
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,613
Peter...

439
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,216
we tampered with the stability
of space-time

440
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:51,884
to resurrect countless lives.

441
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,319
You wanna do it again now
because yours got messy?

442
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,855
It's not about me.

443
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,389
I mean, this is really hurting
a lot of people.

444
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,026
My Aunt May, Happy,

445
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,661
my best friend, my girlfriend,

446
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:05,197
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

447
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,732
and they've done nothing wrong.

448
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,901
I am so sorry...

449
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,037
but even if I wanted to...

450
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,607
I don't have
the Time Stone anymore.

451
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:17,910
That's right.

452
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,583
I'm really sorry
if I wasted your time.

453
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,285
- No. You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

454
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:30,288
He will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

455
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,693
Wong, you've actually
generated a good idea.

456
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:35,827
What?

457
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,930
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

458
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,665
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

459
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,700
It's just a standard
spell of forgetting.

460
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,869
Won't turn back time,
but people will forget

461
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,104
you were ever Spider-Man.

462
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,106
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

463
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,008
That spell travels
the dark borders

464
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,776
between known
and unknown reality.

465
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,178
It's too dangerous.

466
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,780
We've used it for a lot less.

467
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,016
Do you remember the full moon
party at Kamar-Taj?

468
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,751
- No.
- Exactly.

469
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,722
Come on, Wong.

470
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:07,059
Hasn't he been through enough?

471
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,334
Just leave me out of this.

472
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,503
Fine.

473
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:19,772
Fine.

474
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,119
So, what is this place?

475
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,288
The Sanctum's built
at the intersection

476
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,057
of cosmic energy currents.

477
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,391
We weren't the first
to seek them out.

478
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,896
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

479
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,499
And they shot an episode of
<i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

480
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,667
Well, I, um...

481
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,138
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

482
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,340
Don't mention it.

483
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,409
And don't call me "sir."

484
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,279
Right. Sorry.

485
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,680
You ready?

486
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:03,782
I'm ready.

487
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,887
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

488
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,525
Wait, excuse me?

489
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,461
The entire world's
about to forget

490
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,998
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

491
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,532
- Including me.
- Everyone?

492
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,335
Uh, can't some people
still know?

493
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,671
That's not how the spell works.

494
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,373
And it's very difficult
and dangerous

495
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,974
to change it mid-casting.

496
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,176
So my girlfriend's
gonna forget everything?

497
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,745
Is she even gonna be
my girlfriend?

498
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,214
Was she your girlfriend
because you were Spider-Man?

499
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,851
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

500
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,553
Everyone in the world's
gonna forget you're Spider-Man

501
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,289
except your girlfriend.

502
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,190
Thank you so much.

503
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,293
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

504
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,162
What is a Ned?

505
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,397
He's my best friend

506
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,732
so it's important to me
that Ned knows.

507
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:01,340
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell

508
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,142
any more while I'm casting it.

509
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,678
Okay, I'm done.
I swear I'm done. I'm done.

510
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,246
But my Aunt May
should really know.

511
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,881
Peter, stop tampering
with the spell.

512
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,383
When she found out,
it was really messy.

513
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,053
I don't think
I could go through that again.

514
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,355
- So my Aunt May?
- Yes.

515
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:17,723
Thank you. Happy?

516
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,091
No, I'm annoyed.

517
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,026
No, it's a nickname.
Harold "Happy" Hogan.

518
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,295
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

519
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,698
Could you just stop talking?

520
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,907
Basically everyone that knew

521
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,543
I was Spider-Man before
should still know!

522
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,431
- Did it work?
- No.

523
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:02,368
You changed my spell six times.

524
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,069
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

525
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,539
You don't do that. I told you.
And that is why.

526
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,275
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

527
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,678
something catastrophic
could have happened.

528
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,115
- Stephen, listen, I am so...
- Call me "sir."

529
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,251
Sorry, sir.

530
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,187
After everything
we've been through,

531
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:26,492
somehow I always forget
you're just a kid.

532
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,661
Look, Parker, the problem
is not Mysterio.

533
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,997
It's you trying to live
two different lives.

534
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,533
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

535
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,602
Believe me. I'm so sorry

536
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:39,772
about you and your friends
not getting into college,

537
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,908
but if they rejected you
and you tried

538
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,443
to convince them to reconsider,

539
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,779
there's nothing else you can do.

540
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,817
When you say, "Convince them,"

541
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,953
- you mean I could have called them?
- Yeah.

542
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,255
I could do that?

543
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,591
You haven't called the...?

544
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,427
I got their letter.
I assumed that was...

545
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,930
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me

546
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,933
that you didn't even think to
plead your case with them first

547
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,703
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

548
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,408
Well, I mean,
when you put it like that...

549
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,684
Come on, pick up, pick up.

550
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,186
Dude, what? I'm busy.

551
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,488
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
- <i>Why?</i>

552
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,223
Because I need
to talk to someone.

553
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:33,201
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

554
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,561
What's in it for me?

555
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,395
<i>I'm risking a lot
just talking to you.</i>

556
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,398
Okay, I will, um...

557
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:42,000
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

558
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:43,335
For a month.

559
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,204
- <i>For a week.</i>
- Two weeks.

560
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,207
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

561
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,643
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

562
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,679
- <i>Flash, please help me.</i>
- Cool, cool, cool.

563
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,347
<i>There's the
assistant vice chancellor.</i>

564
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:56,761
<i>You can plead your case
with her.</i>

565
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,551
- Perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

566
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,385
- To go where?
- To the airport.

567
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,394
<i>Stark network unavailable.</i>

568
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,030
<i>Facial recognition unavailable.</i>

569
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,401
Hi.

570
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,272
Yeah, I can see you.

571
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,450
Oh, my God.

572
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,320
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

573
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,989
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

574
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,757
No, it's Peter Parker.

575
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,801
Hey.

576
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,270
Okay.

577
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,971
Whew.

578
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,750
- Yeah.
- Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

579
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,485
You do know you're
in the street, right?

580
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,720
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really
needed to talk to you

581
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,623
and I know you're
on your way to the airport.

582
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:14,259
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are the
two smartest people I've met,

583
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,695
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

584
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,697
but if I didn't,
millions would've died,

585
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,933
so please don't let MIT
be dumb like me.

586
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,100
MIT is dumb?

587
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,003
No, I'm saying
don't let MIT be dumb.

588
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:27,439
I mean, like
the dumber version of me

589
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,708
that wouldn't have
let them help.

590
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,878
You didn't rehearse that,
did you, Peter?

591
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,181
Basically, what I'm trying to...

592
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:45,625
Why are you running?

593
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,163
Oh, my God.

594
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,198
Ma'am, you should get out
of the car.

595
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,535
Everybody get off the bridge!

596
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,470
The door's locked.

597
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:00,339
Door's... Hey!

598
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,490
Hello, Peter.

599
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,426
Hi? Do we...? Do I know you?

600
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:23,762
What have you done
with my machine?

601
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,699
I don't know what you're
talking about. What machine?

602
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:29,736
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

603
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,103
It's gone.

604
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,272
Listen, sir,
if you stop smashing cars,

605
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,008
we can work together and I can
help you find your machine.

606
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:37,710
You want to play games?

607
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,446
Catch.

608
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,866
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out.

609
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,537
You think your fancy new suit's
gonna save you?

610
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,252
Should've killed
your little girlfriend

611
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,621
when I had the chance.

612
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:26,892
What did you just say?

613
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,261
Looks like we got competition.

614
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:51,450
Peter! Help!

615
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,407
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

616
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,745
Peter!

617
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:47,172
Ma'am, just stay calm.

618
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,407
Just take a deep breath.

619
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,743
- Are you okay?
- No!

620
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:55,213
I promise, I've got this
all under control.

621
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,989
<i>Suit compromised.</i>

622
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,158
Nanotechnology.

623
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,493
Ah, you've outdone yourself,
Peter.

624
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,636
I underestimated you.

625
00:32:17,837 --> 00:32:19,304
But now you die.

626
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,955
You're not Peter Parker.

627
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,559
I am so confused right now.

628
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,228
What's happening?

629
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,864
<i>New device detected.</i>

630
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,300
<i>Pairing new device.</i>

631
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,040
You don't listen to him.
You listen to me.

632
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,914
Hey.

633
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,422
Whoa.

634
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:16,562
Hey. Hey!

635
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:18,463
Listen to me.

636
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,566
No, not him.
Me.

637
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,641
Ma'am, you okay?

638
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,243
Come on, you can still
make your flight.

639
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,410
Peter.

640
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,013
You're a hero.

641
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,517
No. Well, I'm... No, I'm...

642
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,418
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

643
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:42,922
And I'm gonna talk
to them about you.

644
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,156
But, ma'am, this isn't about me.

645
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,194
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

646
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,863
- Okay?
- Really?

647
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:52,497
And if you keep
your noses clean,

648
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:54,032
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

649
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,636
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

650
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,638
Hey! You! I see you.
Come here!

651
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,306
That was not okay.
Unbelievable.

652
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:03,809
Who are...?

653
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:05,076
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

654
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,846
Until you stop
trying to kill me,

655
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:08,014
I'm in control, buddy,

656
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,081
of this whole tentacle situation

657
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,817
you got going on here, okay?

658
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:13,953
Now, who are you?
What is going...?

659
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,362
No.

660
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,538
Osborn?

661
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
Doctor...?

662
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,239
Be careful
what you wish for, Parker.

663
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:09,875
Let me out of here!

664
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:12,011
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

665
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,713
That little spell
that you botched

666
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:15,246
where you wanted
everyone to forget

667
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,582
that Peter Parker's Spider-Man,

668
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:18,017
it started pulling in everyone

669
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,585
who knows
Peter Parker's Spider-Man

670
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,355
from every universe
into this one.

671
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,391
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

672
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,893
I think it's
better we don't engage

673
00:35:28,027 --> 00:35:29,227
with them because, frankly,

674
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,162
the multiverse
is a concept about which

675
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,733
we know frighteningly little.

676
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:36,035
The multiverse is real?

677
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,770
This shouldn't even be possible.

678
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,106
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

679
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,440
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

680
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,810
After you left, I detected
an otherworldly presence.

681
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:48,246
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

682
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,750
slimy green son of a gun.

683
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,619
Spell? As in magic?

684
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:55,655
What is this, a birthday party?

685
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:58,223
Who is this clown?
What is this madness?

686
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,593
Watch this.
Do you know a Peter Parker

687
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,494
- who's Spider-Man?
- Yes.

688
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:03,929
- Is that him?
- No.

689
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:05,430
See?

690
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,933
Okay, here's what we gotta do.

691
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:10,301
I don't know how many
visitors we've got...

692
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:12,938
I saw another one on the bridge.

693
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:16,542
He was like a flying green elf.

694
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,611
He sounds jolly.
Start with him.

695
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,912
I need you to capture them,

696
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:21,479
bring them here
while I figure out

697
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,049
how to get them back before

698
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,117
they destroy
the fabric of reality,

699
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,452
or worse, Wong finds out.

700
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,155
Uh, Doctor Strange?

701
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,956
What?

702
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,959
My friends and I just got a
second chance to get into MIT,

703
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:36,829
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters...

704
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:38,642
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry but...

705
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,133
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

706
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:49,041
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

707
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:51,811
Hey, you can't just...

708
00:36:54,814 --> 00:36:55,881
How did you do that?

709
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:58,017
Lots of birthday parties.

710
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:05,356
Hey.

711
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,460
Whoa.

712
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,129
One shot,
send them here, move on.

713
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,597
You're welcome. Get to work.

714
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:12,598
Sir?

715
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,501
Now what?

716
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,303
I know this is my mess,
and I swear to you I'll fix it,

717
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,005
but I'm gonna need help.

718
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,775
Whoa!

719
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,544
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

720
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,345
Neither can I.

721
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,049
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

722
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,350
Because my nana says
that we have it in our family,

723
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,285
and I get these tinglings
in my hands...

724
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,420
Talk to your physician.

725
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,822
- Peter.
- Hey.

726
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,724
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

727
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:40,358
Sorry for dragging you
into this.

728
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,229
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize.

729
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,396
You got us a second shot
at MIT. It's fine.

730
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,200
So how did the bad guys
get here?

731
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,903
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

732
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,571
- Wait. What?
- You did it with magic?

733
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,573
I thought it was
the MIT lady you saved.

734
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,075
No, that was after.

735
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,519
Let's just focus
on the good news, okay?

736
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:59,245
No, let's just focus
on the bad news.

737
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:03,414
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

738
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:07,753
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

739
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:10,089
Scooby-Doo this shit.

740
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,191
You're telling us
what to do even though

741
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,093
it was your spell
that got screwed up,

742
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:16,228
meaning that all this
is kind of your mess.

743
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,864
I know a couple of
magic words myself,

744
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,233
starting with
the word "please."

745
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:27,206
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

746
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,608
You can work in the undercroft.

747
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:32,111
The undercroft?

748
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,050
Badass.

749
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,660
- About this whole spell thing...
- It's totally okay.

750
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,162
- Wait, really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

751
00:38:50,296 --> 00:38:54,633
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

752
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,402
Maybe just run it by us
next time, you know?

753
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,939
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

754
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,741
that could break the universe,"

755
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:06,612
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

756
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:09,480
brainstorm ideas.

757
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,551
Deal.

758
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,621
Ned?

759
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:18,757
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

760
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:20,893
Um, oh!

761
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,162
A torture rack.

762
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,166
That is a Pilates machine.

763
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:28,667
- That is...
- The crypt.

764
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,836
Okay, so we get
the rest of the guys,

765
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,938
you zap them, Doctor Magic
will send them back,

766
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:34,640
and when we get into MIT,

767
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:37,009
round of stale doughnuts,
my treat.

768
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,777
Let's catch some multiverse men.

769
00:39:38,911 --> 00:39:41,814
Hey! Who the hell
are these two?

770
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,883
- My friends. This is MJ.
- Hey.

771
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:45,483
- And this is Ned.
- Hello.

772
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:47,452
Uh, I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

773
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:49,487
Dr. Otto Octavius.

774
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,028
Wait, no, seriously,
what's your actual name?

775
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:57,663
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

776
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,720
<i>If the paint
won't come off, I'll get it out.</i>

777
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:24,857
No, no, no. May. We gotta
find these guys first.

778
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,026
<i>Well, finish your mission,
and then come by.</i>

779
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:29,194
<i>We're having
a canned food drive.</i>

780
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:31,230
- That could work.
- I got one.

781
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:32,798
- May, I gotta go.
- <i>Okay.</i>

782
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,967
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

783
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,169
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

784
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:39,638
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

785
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:42,241
A disturbance near
a military research facility

786
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:43,509
outside of the city,

787
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:45,244
and witnesses say that they saw

788
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,346
a monster flying
through the air.

789
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,916
It's gotta be the guy
I saw on the bridge, right?

790
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,284
That's impossible.

791
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,955
You know him, don't you?

792
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:59,725
On the bridge,
you said his name.

793
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,460
Norman Osborn.

794
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:07,032
Brilliant scientist.
Military research.

795
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:10,468
But he was greedy, misguided.

796
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:14,873
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

797
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,543
Okay, um...

798
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,912
I gotta go. Where am I going?

799
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,080
It can't be him.

800
00:41:22,715 --> 00:41:24,350
Why?

801
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,953
Because Norman Osborn
died years ago.

802
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:32,791
So either we saw someone else...

803
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:37,763
or you're flying out into
the darkness to fight a ghost.

804
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:04,523
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

805
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,462
<i>I genuinely don't know how you
do this without throwing up.</i>

806
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,081
Did you guys see that?

807
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,283
<i>Um, no.</i>

808
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:33,118
<i>It's-It's really dark.</i>

809
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,865
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

810
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:54,873
<i>What-What's happening?</i>

811
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,141
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

812
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,045
<i>Are you getting
the tingle thing?</i>

813
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,549
<i>Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?</i>

814
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,826
- Are you guys seeing this?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

815
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,060
<i>Osborn?</i>

816
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:18,197
No. He was green.
This guy's blue.

817
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,300
You wouldn't happen to be from
another universe, would you?

818
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:23,702
<i>What's he doing?</i>

819
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:25,404
<i>I don't know.
Looks like he's charging.</i>

820
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:27,473
I don't like this.
Just web him.

821
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:34,346
Whoa!

822
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:43,188
<i>Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!</i>

823
00:43:43,322 --> 00:43:45,257
<i>What are you talking about?
Right.</i>

824
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,659
<i>Go to the right! Right!
Right! He means right.</i>

825
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,996
- <i>Don't listen to him.</i>
- Guys, this is not helping!

826
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,372
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

827
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:08,714
Whoa.

828
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:13,385
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko.
You remember?

829
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,053
I'm Peter,
but I'm not your Peter.

830
00:44:15,187 --> 00:44:16,722
What do you mean,
you're not my Peter?

831
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,423
What the hell is going on?

832
00:44:18,558 --> 00:44:20,792
I'll explain, but first,
can you help me?

833
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,761
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

834
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:25,230
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

835
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:42,781
I can't hold him much longer.

836
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:44,483
I got it, I got it!

837
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,346
Different Peter. Weird.

838
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,650
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

839
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,093
I got my body back.

840
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:29,861
Hey, um...

841
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,797
This is gonna sound
really crazy,

842
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,499
but this isn't your universe.

843
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:34,833
Another universe?

844
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:35,968
- Uh-huh.
- What?

845
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:37,936
That's what I was feeling.

846
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,205
The power, it's different.

847
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,975
I like it.

848
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:46,478
Easy, buddy.

849
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,480
It's actually my fault
that you're here.

850
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:52,351
Like, the universe or the woods?

851
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:53,352
I hate the woods.

852
00:45:53,485 --> 00:45:55,354
I meant the universe, sir.

853
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:57,155
So, what, y'all
just gonna stand here

854
00:45:57,289 --> 00:45:58,857
and act like I ain't
butt-ass naked?

855
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:01,159
- I am.
- No, no.

856
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:02,361
I, uh...

857
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,875
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

858
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:18,944
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

859
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:20,713
I can explain everything.
Trust me.

860
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:22,180
Please just trust me.

861
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:24,182
I don't trust you.
I don't know you.

862
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,253
What is this?

863
00:46:29,555 --> 00:46:31,056
You picked the wrong side.

864
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,993
Connors?

865
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,564
Wait. You know this creature?

866
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:42,769
No, no, no.
Not a creature. A man.

867
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:44,102
The same universes.

868
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,271
Dr. Curt Connors.
He was a scientist

869
00:46:46,405 --> 00:46:48,173
at Oscorp when I worked there.

870
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:50,275
A brilliant scientist.

871
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:52,010
Until he turned himself
into a lizard.

872
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,212
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

873
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:56,716
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

874
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,917
It was the next step
in human evolution.

875
00:46:59,051 --> 00:47:01,086
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

876
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,021
Speaking of which
what happened to you?

877
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:04,990
Last I recall,
you had bad teeth,

878
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:06,592
glasses and a comb-over.

879
00:47:06,726 --> 00:47:09,227
Did you get a makeover?

880
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:11,798
You know I can give you
a real makeover.

881
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,265
Let me guess, into a lizard?

882
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,901
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

883
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,670
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

884
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:20,405
- A wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

885
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,307
There's no real way
to sugarcoat that.

886
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,176
It's literally the dungeon
of a wizard.

887
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,845
You can keep your magic.

888
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,716
I want a taste of that
new energy I just felt.

889
00:47:33,085 --> 00:47:36,021
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

890
00:47:36,154 --> 00:47:38,090
There should be
an electric guy and a sand guy.

891
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:40,727
Yeah, they're all here
and locked up.

892
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,539
Perfect. I'm gonna just
stay here for a bit

893
00:47:42,628 --> 00:47:43,938
and try and fix
some of this damage

894
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:45,565
so they don't blame it
on me again.

895
00:47:45,698 --> 00:47:48,900
- <i>Okay.</i>
- But, hey, I, uh...

896
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,504
I couldn't do any of this
without you, so thank you.

897
00:47:51,637 --> 00:47:52,637
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

898
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:54,607
Hey, ask him if this is,

899
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,576
like, a tree monster or, like,

900
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:58,611
a scientist
that turned into a tree.

901
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:02,013
It's just a tree, man.
Just a tree.

902
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:22,300
<i>Coward.
We have a new world to conquer.</i>

903
00:48:24,469 --> 00:48:25,671
<i>You make me sick.</i>

904
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:27,740
Leave me alone, please.

905
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:30,909
<i>Hiding in the shadows.</i>

906
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:33,278
<i>Hiding from who you truly are.</i>

907
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:36,982
- No.
- <i>You can't escape yourself.</i>

908
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:56,334
- Hey, May.
- <i>Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...</i>

909
00:48:56,468 --> 00:48:59,505
<i>one of the guys you're
looking for just walked in.</i>

910
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,281
May? Where's May?

911
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:10,449
Thank you.

912
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,554
May.

913
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:18,190
Ah, hey, here he is.

914
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:21,594
Norman, this is my nephew.

915
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:25,598
Norman Osborn?
I thought that you were...

916
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:30,202
I saw Spider-Man
in an ad for this place.

917
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:32,705
And I thought he could help me.

918
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,072
But you're not him.

919
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:36,509
Wait, so you want
Spider-Man's help?

920
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:38,376
He just wandered in.

921
00:49:41,246 --> 00:49:43,181
I didn't know where else to go.

922
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,786
Someone's living in my house.

923
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,288
Oscorp doesn't exist.

924
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,258
My son...

925
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:00,566
Sometimes I'm not myself.

926
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:04,202
I'm someone else.

927
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:06,338
- Mm-hm.
- And every time he's in control,

928
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:08,641
- I can't remember.
- Who? Who's in control?

929
00:50:08,774 --> 00:50:10,610
- And now I'm here...
- Who's in control?

930
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:13,813
- I don't know what's going on.
- Okay, it's okay.

931
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:17,650
And I don't...
Doesn't make sense.

932
00:50:17,783 --> 00:50:19,519
He's lost.

933
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:23,623
And I don't mean just in
the cosmos. I mean in his mind.

934
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,159
Are they all like this?

935
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

936
00:50:29,461 --> 00:50:30,863
They all have their own

937
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:32,798
mental or physical issues.

938
00:50:32,932 --> 00:50:36,636
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

939
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:39,939
Wait, you don't mean...?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

940
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,842
Peter, not your problem? Hmm?

941
00:50:42,975 --> 00:50:45,645
May. Their chance
of getting help is way better

942
00:50:45,778 --> 00:50:47,613
back where they came from.

943
00:50:47,747 --> 00:50:49,281
Sending them home,

944
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,349
that's the best thing
we can do for them.

945
00:50:51,483 --> 00:50:54,152
For them? Or for yourself?

946
00:50:56,822 --> 00:51:00,026
Look around you.
This is what we do.

947
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:04,931
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

948
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,532
Trust me.

949
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:13,238
<i>But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.</i>

950
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:15,508
We'll be right back
after a brief word

951
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,543
from <i>Daily Bugle</i> Supplements.

952
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:20,412
The only other daily fix
you need.

953
00:51:20,546 --> 00:51:22,380
And we're out.

954
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,483
What?

955
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:29,755
I got eyes on him.

956
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:31,423
<i>He's with his aunt and some guy.</i>

957
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:33,526
- You sure?
- <i>They're leaving the shelter.</i>

958
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:35,327
Okay. Don't lose him.

959
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:49,041
Thanks, May.
Hope to see you again.

960
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:53,178
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

961
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,516
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

962
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,051
I'll see you later.

963
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,923
- Um, guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

964
00:52:04,056 --> 00:52:06,224
Sorry. Um, Dr. Osborn,
these are my friends.

965
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:08,193
This is Ned and MJ.

966
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:12,064
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

967
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,266
Fascinating.

968
00:52:19,204 --> 00:52:21,373
Do you think
there are other Ned Leedses?

969
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,088
Octavius?

970
00:52:40,092 --> 00:52:42,028
Osborn?

971
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,098
- What... What happened to you?
- What happened to...?

972
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,901
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

973
00:52:49,035 --> 00:52:51,537
You died, Norman.

974
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:53,304
Years ago.

975
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:55,775
You're insane.

976
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:58,944
- God, I love it here.
- What are you talking about?

977
00:52:59,078 --> 00:53:00,780
He's standing right there.
He's not...

978
00:53:00,913 --> 00:53:03,716
Dead. They both died,

979
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,818
fighting Spider-Man.

980
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:11,157
It was all over the news.

981
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:16,028
Green Goblin, impaled by
the glider you flew around on.

982
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:20,432
And a couple of years later,
you, Doc Ock,

983
00:53:20,566 --> 00:53:22,333
drowned in the river
with your machine.

984
00:53:22,467 --> 00:53:24,503
That's nonsense.

985
00:53:24,637 --> 00:53:28,007
Spider-Man was trying
to stop my fusion reactor,

986
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,842
so I stopped him.

987
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:34,046
I had him by the throat,
and then I...

988
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:41,053
- And then I was here.
- Ah, please.

989
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:44,190
Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

990
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,792
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

991
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:49,095
I was stuck in the grid,
absorbing data.

992
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,530
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

993
00:53:51,664 --> 00:53:53,499
And then, uh...

994
00:53:53,632 --> 00:53:56,936
And then... Oh, shit.

995
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:00,940
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

996
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:06,545
Oh, great.
You caught another one.

997
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,681
No, wait, Strange.
He's not dangerous.

998
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,651
It's okay. Um...

999
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,222
What is that?

1000
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,924
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

1001
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:20,538
I trapped
your corrupted spell inside,

1002
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:22,427
and once I finish
the proper ritual,

1003
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:23,863
it'll reverse the spell

1004
00:54:23,996 --> 00:54:26,565
and send these guys
back to their universes.

1005
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:29,168
And then what? We perish?

1006
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,936
No. No, thanks.
I'll pass on that.

1007
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,540
Let me out of here. Peter!

1008
00:54:34,673 --> 00:54:38,878
Strange, we can't
send them back. Not yet.

1009
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:41,213
Why?

1010
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:43,582
Well, some of these guys
are gonna die.

1011
00:54:43,716 --> 00:54:47,253
Parker, it's their fate.

1012
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,556
Come on, Strange, have a heart.

1013
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:54,927
In the grand calculus
of the multiverse,

1014
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:59,031
their sacrifice means infinitely
more than their lives.

1015
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:06,939
I'm sorry, kid.

1016
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:09,942
If they die, they die.

1017
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:24,455
Peter!

1018
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:38,970
Don't.

1019
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:44,088
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go, go.

1020
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,778
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

1021
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,949
This is why I never had kids.

1022
00:56:03,696 --> 00:56:05,430
- Give me the box.
- No.

1023
00:56:06,431 --> 00:56:07,499
Whoa!

1024
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:25,618
- Oh, my God, I'm dead.
- You're not dead,

1025
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:27,953
you've just been separated
from your physical form.

1026
00:56:28,087 --> 00:56:30,723
My physical... What?

1027
00:56:30,856 --> 00:56:33,792
- How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

1028
00:56:33,926 --> 00:56:36,295
You should not
be able to do that.

1029
00:56:36,427 --> 00:56:38,297
This feels amazing.

1030
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:50,952
That's one of the coolest
things that's happened to me,

1031
00:56:50,976 --> 00:56:52,511
but don't ever do that again.

1032
00:56:58,617 --> 00:57:00,485
Wha... Hey! Get off of me!

1033
00:57:26,979 --> 00:57:28,247
<i>♪ La, la ♪</i>

1034
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,517
<i>♪ Tis the season
To be jolly... ♪</i>

1035
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:51,437
- What is this place?
- The Mirror Dimension,

1036
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,205
where I'm in control.

1037
00:58:02,314 --> 00:58:04,750
Strange, stop. Can we
please just talk about this?

1038
00:58:04,883 --> 00:58:07,853
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse

1039
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:10,189
there are an infinite number
of people

1040
00:58:10,322 --> 00:58:12,524
who know Peter Parker
is Spider-Man?

1041
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:15,461
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

1042
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:18,297
I know, I get it, but we can't
just send them home to die.

1043
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,199
It's their fate.

1044
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:21,600
You can't change that

1045
00:58:21,734 --> 00:58:23,736
any more than you could
change who they are.

1046
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:27,339
But what if we could? What if
we could change their fate?

1047
00:58:27,473 --> 00:58:29,842
Whoa! Oh, what are you doing?

1048
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:36,815
I'm not giving you the... Whoa!

1049
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,352
Whoa! Whoa!

1050
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:49,194
Give me that back.

1051
00:59:09,748 --> 00:59:11,984
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

1052
00:59:12,117 --> 00:59:13,852
The Mirror Dimension
is just geometry?

1053
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:16,288
You're great at geometry.
You can do geometry.

1054
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:19,958
Square the radius.
Divide by pi.

1055
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:23,028
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

1056
00:59:23,162 --> 00:59:25,631
I'll come pick you up
when it's done.

1057
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,568
Hey, Strange.

1058
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:31,904
You know
what's cooler than magic?

1059
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,709
- Math.
- Don't do this.

1060
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:42,748
- Ow.
- I'm sorry, sir, but...

1061
00:59:47,186 --> 00:59:48,521
I have to try.

1062
00:59:51,824 --> 00:59:54,093
- What happened?
- I fought with Strange and won.

1063
00:59:54,226 --> 00:59:56,995
- What?
- Look, I stole his ring thing.

1064
00:59:57,129 --> 00:59:59,898
I was swinging through the city,
and then I went through

1065
01:00:00,032 --> 01:00:01,910
this massive mirror thing,
and then I was back in...

1066
01:00:01,934 --> 01:00:03,635
- Where is he?
- He's trapped,

1067
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:06,805
- but I'm not sure for how long.
- You could have left us to die.

1068
01:00:06,939 --> 01:00:08,340
Why didn't you?

1069
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:10,008
Because that's not who he is.

1070
01:00:13,312 --> 01:00:15,314
I think I can help you guys.

1071
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:18,150
If I can fix what happened
to you, then when you go back,

1072
01:00:18,283 --> 01:00:19,586
things will be different,

1073
01:00:19,718 --> 01:00:21,687
and you might not die
fighting Spider-Man.

1074
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,099
- What do you mean fix us?
- Our technology is advanced...

1075
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:28,595
I can help you. You know, I'm
something of a scientist myself.

1076
01:00:30,563 --> 01:00:32,364
Octavius knows what I can do.

1077
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:35,033
Fix? You mean like a dog?

1078
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,435
I refuse.

1079
01:00:36,569 --> 01:00:38,437
I can't promise
you guys anything,

1080
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:41,473
but at least this way, you get
to go home and have a chance.

1081
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:43,308
A second chance.

1082
01:00:43,442 --> 01:00:45,244
Come on,
isn't that worth trying?

1083
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:48,914
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

1084
01:00:49,047 --> 01:00:51,750
there are always consequences.

1085
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:53,620
I mean, you don't have to come.

1086
01:00:53,752 --> 01:00:55,654
I also didn't know
that you could talk.

1087
01:00:55,787 --> 01:00:57,156
But if you stay here,

1088
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:59,057
you're gonna have to deal
with the wizard.

1089
01:00:59,191 --> 01:01:03,630
Ah, so we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

1090
01:01:03,762 --> 01:01:06,465
- I just wanna go home.
- Well, I, myself,

1091
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,066
don't wanna be killed,

1092
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,036
especially by a guy dressed
like Dungeons & Dragons,

1093
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,605
so, what's your plan?

1094
01:01:14,006 --> 01:01:16,074
I have it all under control.

1095
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:21,246
What are we
gonna do about this thing?

1096
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,049
Uh, well, we need to find
somewhere safe for it, right?

1097
01:01:24,183 --> 01:01:26,118
- Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

1098
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:28,555
If something bad happens,
you just push this,

1099
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:31,423
- and then it's all over.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1100
01:01:31,558 --> 01:01:33,792
You can't. It's dangerous.
You've done enough.

1101
01:01:33,926 --> 01:01:36,207
- We're in this together.
- I know we're in this together,

1102
01:01:36,328 --> 01:01:38,463
but I can't do this
if you're in danger.

1103
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:41,433
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1104
01:01:44,303 --> 01:01:46,639
- Please.
- Fine.

1105
01:01:46,772 --> 01:01:48,173
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

1106
01:01:48,307 --> 01:01:50,610
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1107
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:54,046
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

1108
01:01:54,179 --> 01:01:55,814
Yeah, we all believe you,
Michelle.

1109
01:01:55,948 --> 01:01:58,817
No way that's his girlfriend.
No way.

1110
01:01:58,951 --> 01:02:02,821
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

1111
01:02:02,955 --> 01:02:05,791
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

1112
01:02:05,924 --> 01:02:07,292
- You too.
- Okay.

1113
01:02:08,994 --> 01:02:10,429
Whoa.

1114
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,532
Okay.

1115
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:16,201
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

1116
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,277
So, uh...

1117
01:02:26,345 --> 01:02:28,113
who's coming with me?

1118
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,318
Well, I'm in.

1119
01:02:33,452 --> 01:02:36,888
But if this goes sideways...

1120
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:39,659
I'm gonna fry you
from the inside out.

1121
01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:52,871
<i>Where's Connors?</i>

1122
01:02:53,005 --> 01:02:54,574
<i>He wants to stay in the truck.</i>

1123
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:56,208
<i>Okay.</i>

1124
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:58,277
<i>Alarm system deactivated.</i>

1125
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,178
Hey, May.

1126
01:03:00,312 --> 01:03:01,913
- Yeah?
- I feel kind of bad

1127
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:05,217
- using Happy's place like this.
- No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1128
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:08,020
<i>New Yorkers</i>

1129
01:03:08,153 --> 01:03:10,989
- <i>oppose the renovation...</i>
- Oh, sorry.

1130
01:03:11,123 --> 01:03:14,493
So this is your plan, Peter, hm?
No lab, no facilities?

1131
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:17,262
Just performing miracles
in a condominium, hm?

1132
01:03:17,396 --> 01:03:18,897
What, you gonna cook us
some cures

1133
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:20,832
and some frozen burritos
in a microwave?

1134
01:03:20,966 --> 01:03:23,703
- I could go for a burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1135
01:03:23,835 --> 01:03:25,738
Well, let's hope not.

1136
01:03:25,871 --> 01:03:27,939
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1137
01:03:28,073 --> 01:03:30,342
Hey, I told you,
I don't need fixing.

1138
01:03:30,475 --> 01:03:32,444
I don't need fixing.

1139
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:35,113
Especially by a teenager
using scraps

1140
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:36,783
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1141
01:03:36,915 --> 01:03:39,985
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1142
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:42,555
I can feel it.
That weird energy.

1143
01:03:43,955 --> 01:03:45,090
What the hell is that?

1144
01:03:45,223 --> 01:03:46,958
It's a fabricator.

1145
01:03:47,092 --> 01:03:51,463
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1146
01:03:51,597 --> 01:03:53,800
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1147
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:57,804
Look at that.

1148
01:04:05,143 --> 01:04:06,679
He's gonna kill us all.

1149
01:04:14,787 --> 01:04:17,222
Whoa. What's going on there?

1150
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:19,625
So the chip in
the back of Doc's neck

1151
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:22,060
was designed to protect
his brain from the AI system

1152
01:04:22,194 --> 01:04:23,629
that's controlling
these tentacles,

1153
01:04:23,763 --> 01:04:27,800
but if you look here...
the chip is fried.

1154
01:04:27,933 --> 01:04:30,435
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1155
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,505
the tentacles are now
in control of him.

1156
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:37,777
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1157
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:47,386
Thirsty?

1158
01:04:50,255 --> 01:04:52,324
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1159
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:54,727
Fresh water or salt?

1160
01:04:54,861 --> 01:04:56,895
You know,
because you're an octopus.

1161
01:04:58,598 --> 01:04:59,832
What?

1162
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:02,635
Fresh water it is.

1163
01:05:03,669 --> 01:05:05,571
Look at this place.

1164
01:05:05,705 --> 01:05:08,875
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1165
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:12,043
Yeah, yeah, the condo. I love
the whole open floor plan. No.

1166
01:05:12,177 --> 01:05:15,180
No, man,
I'm talking about the world.

1167
01:05:15,313 --> 01:05:17,617
I kind of like who I am here.

1168
01:05:19,117 --> 01:05:21,788
And all that power back there...

1169
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,856
I could be so much more.

1170
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:25,725
So why'd you come along?

1171
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:28,728
I have a daughter,
and I want to see her.

1172
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:30,962
But he's not gonna
send anyone home

1173
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:34,332
till he's finished his little
science project back there.

1174
01:05:34,466 --> 01:05:35,668
You trust him?

1175
01:05:35,802 --> 01:05:37,335
I don't trust anyone.

1176
01:05:38,504 --> 01:05:40,038
How'd you end up
like that anyway?

1177
01:05:40,172 --> 01:05:41,908
Oh...

1178
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,776
the place where I worked at,

1179
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,278
they were experimenting
with electricity

1180
01:05:46,411 --> 01:05:49,515
created by living organisms,
and then, uh...

1181
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:51,851
I fell into
a vat of electric eels.

1182
01:05:51,983 --> 01:05:54,921
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1183
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:56,789
Damn.

1184
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:58,758
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1185
01:05:59,692 --> 01:06:01,293
Remarkable.

1186
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:05,263
The technology and you.

1187
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:10,736
When all this is over,
if you need a job

1188
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:15,575
and you're willing to commute
to another universe...

1189
01:06:20,813 --> 01:06:23,683
It worked. That totally worked.

1190
01:06:23,816 --> 01:06:26,218
I got it. I did it.
Uh, will you send him up?

1191
01:06:26,351 --> 01:06:27,720
Here we go.

1192
01:06:28,754 --> 01:06:30,188
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1193
01:06:30,322 --> 01:06:32,892
Oh, will these humiliations
never cease?

1194
01:06:33,024 --> 01:06:35,928
You, keep your science fair
project away from me!

1195
01:06:36,061 --> 01:06:37,630
It'll work. Have faith.

1196
01:06:37,763 --> 01:06:40,733
Says the reckless fool who
turned himself into a monster.

1197
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,903
Please stop moving your head.

1198
01:06:44,035 --> 01:06:46,506
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1199
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:53,779
Ugh! I swear,
when I get out of this,

1200
01:06:53,913 --> 01:06:56,281
we're gonna rip you a new...

1201
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:01,486
Doc?

1202
01:07:07,058 --> 01:07:08,293
Doc?

1203
01:07:09,996 --> 01:07:11,263
Doc?

1204
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,900
Dr. Octav...

1205
01:07:20,138 --> 01:07:21,741
It's so quiet.

1206
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,581
Those voices inside my head...

1207
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:34,954
I'd almost forgotten.

1208
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:37,422
Otto.

1209
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:40,660
Yes. Norman.

1210
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:47,967
It's me.

1211
01:07:50,135 --> 01:07:51,537
Would you look at that.

1212
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:15,160
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1213
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:17,295
Yeah, you're welcome.

1214
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:19,065
How can I help?

1215
01:08:19,197 --> 01:08:21,299
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

1216
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:24,003
Uh, yeah, Peter, this is Happy.

1217
01:08:24,135 --> 01:08:25,805
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1218
01:08:25,938 --> 01:08:28,074
Who are those guys, huh?
Is that a cyborg?

1219
01:08:28,206 --> 01:08:30,543
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1220
01:08:30,676 --> 01:08:33,244
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1221
01:08:42,387 --> 01:08:44,422
How does it feel, Norman?

1222
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:47,026
You're about
to become whole again.

1223
01:08:48,193 --> 01:08:50,730
No more darker half.

1224
01:08:50,863 --> 01:08:51,964
Just you.

1225
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:54,366
Just me.

1226
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:04,543
Okay, um...

1227
01:09:06,045 --> 01:09:09,147
It just goes right here. This...

1228
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,783
That should be
drawing power now.

1229
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:12,785
I'm gonna come back
in a second to check,

1230
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:15,087
but keep an eye on the lights.
When they're all green,

1231
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,590
it means the electricity
in your body's dissipated.

1232
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:19,058
Well, not all
of the electricity.

1233
01:09:19,224 --> 01:09:21,426
You need electricity
for your brain to function.

1234
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,428
Your nervous system is...

1235
01:09:23,562 --> 01:09:26,599
I'm not really sure why I'm
explaining electricity to you.

1236
01:09:26,732 --> 01:09:28,634
- Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1237
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:31,137
Are these your Legos?

1238
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:34,640
Uh, I gotta go. I'll be back.

1239
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:43,481
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1240
01:09:43,616 --> 01:09:46,085
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1241
01:09:46,217 --> 01:09:49,855
The sooner you guys get through
this, the sooner we go home.

1242
01:09:57,897 --> 01:10:00,132
- Well, where is he?
- Uh, he's inside.

1243
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:01,867
And yet here we are, outside.

1244
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:03,969
Did you not hear me say,
"Don't lose him?"

1245
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:06,105
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1246
01:10:06,237 --> 01:10:08,037
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1247
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,709
And so it begins.

1248
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:11,711
place is about
to be swarming with cops.

1249
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:32,131
Peter?

1250
01:10:33,566 --> 01:10:34,800
What's wrong?

1251
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:37,670
I don't know.

1252
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:38,871
May?

1253
01:10:44,476 --> 01:10:45,978
What is it, Peter?

1254
01:10:53,052 --> 01:10:54,587
What's happening?

1255
01:11:01,326 --> 01:11:03,529
Why are you
looking at me like that?

1256
01:11:18,677 --> 01:11:23,381
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1257
01:11:23,516 --> 01:11:27,653
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1258
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:30,055
- The hell?
- The Goblin.

1259
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:33,192
"No more darker half"?

1260
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:36,729
Did you really think
that I'd let that happen?

1261
01:11:36,862 --> 01:11:40,266
That I'd let you take away my
power just because you're blind

1262
01:11:40,398 --> 01:11:42,935
to what true power
can bring you?

1263
01:11:43,068 --> 01:11:44,603
- You don't know me.
- Don't I?

1264
01:11:48,373 --> 01:11:53,913
I saw how she trapped you,
fighting her holy moral mission.

1265
01:11:56,582 --> 01:11:58,717
We don't need you to save us.

1266
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:00,953
We don't need to be fixed.

1267
01:12:04,422 --> 01:12:07,159
These are not curses.

1268
01:12:07,293 --> 01:12:09,460
They're gifts.

1269
01:12:10,763 --> 01:12:12,731
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1270
01:12:12,865 --> 01:12:14,733
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1271
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:19,805
I've watched you from deep
behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1272
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:25,277
Struggling to have
everything you want

1273
01:12:25,410 --> 01:12:28,914
while the world tries
to make you choose.

1274
01:12:31,116 --> 01:12:34,653
Gods don't have to choose.

1275
01:12:36,522 --> 01:12:37,923
We take.

1276
01:12:38,057 --> 01:12:39,490
May, run.

1277
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:04,650
Oh, my God.

1278
01:13:04,783 --> 01:13:07,987
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1279
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:20,900
Up here. He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1280
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:44,390
Did you see that?

1281
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,618
No, you don't!

1282
01:14:21,393 --> 01:14:23,796
Strong enough to have it all.

1283
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:29,068
Too weak to take it!

1284
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,471
Now I got you.

1285
01:15:07,706 --> 01:15:09,942
I told you
there'd be consequences.

1286
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:32,031
Your weakness, Peter,
is morality.

1287
01:15:32,164 --> 01:15:36,135
It's choking you.
Can't you feel it?

1288
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,744
It didn't work.

1289
01:15:47,112 --> 01:15:48,680
Norman was right.

1290
01:15:48,814 --> 01:15:52,618
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1291
01:15:57,256 --> 01:15:59,658
You tried to fix me.

1292
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:03,429
- May, go.
- Now I'm gonna fix you.

1293
01:16:07,032 --> 01:16:08,400
May, run, please.

1294
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:13,405
May!

1295
01:16:19,645 --> 01:16:21,747
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1296
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,384
No good deed goes unpunished.

1297
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,753
You can thank me later.

1298
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:34,960
No!

1299
01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:05,558
- May?
- Peter.

1300
01:17:05,691 --> 01:17:07,459
May, May, I'm here.

1301
01:17:07,594 --> 01:17:09,529
Oh!

1302
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:12,364
- May.
- Oh!

1303
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:14,366
May, I'm here.

1304
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:16,101
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1305
01:17:16,235 --> 01:17:17,436
What happened?

1306
01:17:20,573 --> 01:17:21,608
Okay... Oh!

1307
01:17:23,242 --> 01:17:25,210
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1308
01:17:25,344 --> 01:17:26,979
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1309
01:17:27,112 --> 01:17:28,232
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1310
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:32,050
I think I broke my ribs.

1311
01:17:37,356 --> 01:17:39,458
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1312
01:17:39,592 --> 01:17:41,493
I should have let Strange
send them back.

1313
01:17:41,628 --> 01:17:43,495
You did the right thing.

1314
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,397
They would have been killed.

1315
01:17:45,532 --> 01:17:47,299
You did the right thing.

1316
01:17:47,432 --> 01:17:49,935
It's not my responsibility, May.

1317
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,306
Oh. What Norman said?

1318
01:17:55,642 --> 01:17:57,577
My moral mission? No.

1319
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,978
- No, May...
- Peter, you listen to me.

1320
01:18:01,146 --> 01:18:02,247
You have a gift.

1321
01:18:03,749 --> 01:18:05,851
You have power.

1322
01:18:05,984 --> 01:18:07,352
And with great power,

1323
01:18:07,486 --> 01:18:11,558
there must also come
great responsibility, mm?

1324
01:18:16,228 --> 01:18:17,664
Yeah, I know.

1325
01:18:17,796 --> 01:18:19,464
Let's get the... out of here.

1326
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:21,266
Okay, let's go.

1327
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,069
Let me just catch my...

1328
01:18:39,451 --> 01:18:41,654
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1329
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:43,623
Yeah, you're okay.
What happened?

1330
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,459
Just have to...

1331
01:18:47,594 --> 01:18:49,761
- catch my breath.
- Okay, well, catch your breath.

1332
01:18:49,895 --> 01:18:51,797
I'm right here.
We're gonna take our time.

1333
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,165
You catch your breath.

1334
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:55,668
Then we'll take you
to a doctor, okay?

1335
01:19:13,318 --> 01:19:15,254
Are you okay?

1336
01:19:15,387 --> 01:19:18,223
Somebody help! I need
an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1337
01:19:18,357 --> 01:19:21,260
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1338
01:19:21,393 --> 01:19:23,095
You're okay, you're okay.

1339
01:19:24,796 --> 01:19:27,199
Let me just...
Let me catch my breath.

1340
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:29,669
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1341
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:31,403
I'm right here.

1342
01:19:37,843 --> 01:19:39,244
You're okay.

1343
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:42,047
It's just me and you.

1344
01:19:51,823 --> 01:19:53,058
May?

1345
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:00,600
May?

1346
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:08,473
Will you look at me,
May, please?

1347
01:20:16,749 --> 01:20:17,916
May.

1348
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,052
May.

1349
01:20:21,253 --> 01:20:22,854
What are you doing, May?

1350
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:25,692
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1351
01:20:48,548 --> 01:20:50,315
Get out of the car now! Move!

1352
01:20:56,789 --> 01:20:58,558
Get off, get off, get off me.

1353
01:21:00,827 --> 01:21:03,462
- Peter! Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1354
01:21:03,596 --> 01:21:05,430
It's just me and you, okay?

1355
01:21:05,565 --> 01:21:08,501
Oh, May, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1356
01:21:08,634 --> 01:21:10,670
I'm so, so, so sorry.
I love you.

1357
01:21:10,803 --> 01:21:13,305
All right, Parker!
Come out with your hands up!

1358
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:15,941
Come out right
now, or we will open fire!

1359
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:17,876
Run!

1360
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:23,683
All right, let's go.
Let's go! Move in!

1361
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:42,835
<i>Tragedy.</i>

1362
01:21:46,171 --> 01:21:48,574
<i>What else can I call it?</i>

1363
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:50,676
<i>What more need be said?</i>

1364
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:54,881
<i>The damage, the destruction.</i>

1365
01:21:55,013 --> 01:21:57,583
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.</i>

1366
01:21:57,717 --> 01:22:00,586
<i>When will people wake up
and realize</i>

1367
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:03,255
<i>that everywhere Spider-Man goes,</i>

1368
01:22:03,388 --> 01:22:06,958
<i>chaos and calamity ensue?</i>

1369
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:12,164
<i>Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.</i>

1370
01:22:12,297 --> 01:22:14,834
<i>And we, the innocents,</i>

1371
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:17,402
<i>are left to pick up the pieces.</i>

1372
01:22:19,438 --> 01:22:21,507
<i>J. Jonah Jameson reporting.</i>

1373
01:22:21,641 --> 01:22:24,911
<i>Good night, and God help us all.</i>

1374
01:22:44,362 --> 01:22:47,500
<i>We are told that multiple
people have been injured,</i>

1375
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:52,070
<i>and we can confirm at least
one person has been killed...</i>

1376
01:22:52,204 --> 01:22:53,706
Still nothing?

1377
01:22:54,907 --> 01:22:56,341
No.

1378
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:13,391
I'm gonna press it.

1379
01:23:14,861 --> 01:23:17,563
- What? No, he...
- I know he told me to wait...

1380
01:23:18,898 --> 01:23:21,066
- but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish...

1381
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,902
I just wish we could see him.

1382
01:23:28,106 --> 01:23:30,075
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1383
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:32,244
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1384
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:36,314
I just wish we could see him.

1385
01:23:38,283 --> 01:23:40,786
Oh. Okay.

1386
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,288
I just wish we could see Peter.

1387
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:49,427
Whoa.

1388
01:23:49,562 --> 01:23:52,497
<i>Lola,</i> you're right. I am magic.

1389
01:23:52,632 --> 01:23:54,366
Is that him?

1390
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,836
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1391
01:23:56,969 --> 01:23:58,504
- Hey, Peter!
- Peter!

1392
01:23:58,638 --> 01:24:00,105
Yeah.

1393
01:24:04,409 --> 01:24:05,409
Whoa!

1394
01:24:07,445 --> 01:24:08,948
Hi. Hi.

1395
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,117
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1396
01:24:14,854 --> 01:24:16,288
Okay.

1397
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:21,326
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1398
01:24:21,459 --> 01:24:25,531
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1399
01:24:25,665 --> 01:24:28,834
But then yesterday, I was...

1400
01:24:30,503 --> 01:24:32,370
I was just here.

1401
01:24:33,906 --> 01:24:35,173
Wow.

1402
01:24:36,776 --> 01:24:41,346
String theory,
multi-dimensional reality...

1403
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:43,683
and matter displacement.

1404
01:24:43,816 --> 01:24:45,651
- All real?
- Yeah.

1405
01:24:45,785 --> 01:24:47,385
I knew it.

1406
01:24:48,688 --> 01:24:50,990
This has to be
because of the spell.

1407
01:24:51,122 --> 01:24:52,825
The spell? Like magic spell?

1408
01:24:52,959 --> 01:24:54,794
- There's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1409
01:24:54,927 --> 01:24:56,629
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean...

1410
01:24:56,762 --> 01:24:58,531
- Shut up, Ned.
- No, it's not <i>real.</i>

1411
01:24:58,664 --> 01:25:01,734
- Shut up. Stop talking.
- There's magicians, but no...

1412
01:25:01,867 --> 01:25:04,202
Stop. Stop.

1413
01:25:04,336 --> 01:25:05,638
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1414
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:07,740
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry

1415
01:25:07,873 --> 01:25:09,407
an ID with me, you know?

1416
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:12,310
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1417
01:25:14,346 --> 01:25:16,426
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle.

1418
01:25:16,549 --> 01:25:18,483
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1419
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:20,553
Can you not
throw the bread again?

1420
01:25:20,686 --> 01:25:23,388
You're a deeply
mistrusting person...

1421
01:25:24,657 --> 01:25:26,257
and I respect it.

1422
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:32,098
Crawl around.

1423
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:34,100
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1424
01:25:34,232 --> 01:25:35,801
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1425
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:37,535
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1426
01:25:37,603 --> 01:25:38,904
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1427
01:25:39,038 --> 01:25:40,749
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. Nuh-uh.

1428
01:25:40,773 --> 01:25:43,408
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1429
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,978
Ned.

1430
01:25:51,617 --> 01:25:53,385
My <i>lola's</i> asking
if you could just

1431
01:25:53,519 --> 01:25:54,987
get the cobweb there.

1432
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:57,389
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1433
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:06,666
Thank you.

1434
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:12,104
We goo...?

1435
01:26:12,237 --> 01:26:14,674
- We good?
- For now.

1436
01:26:14,807 --> 01:26:17,743
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1437
01:26:17,877 --> 01:26:20,112
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1438
01:26:20,245 --> 01:26:22,682
- Ouch.
- No offense.

1439
01:26:22,815 --> 01:26:24,650
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1440
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,054
Find Peter Parker.

1441
01:26:28,186 --> 01:26:30,156
- What's the thing on his hand?
- Shh.

1442
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:32,591
Find Peter Parker.

1443
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:36,294
Find Peter Parker!

1444
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:47,439
Great, it's just
some random guy.

1445
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:48,774
Hello.

1446
01:26:48,908 --> 01:26:50,241
Um, I hope it's okay,

1447
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:52,343
I just came through this, uh...

1448
01:26:52,477 --> 01:26:54,479
Oh. It just closed.

1449
01:26:55,948 --> 01:26:57,149
You're Peter?

1450
01:26:57,282 --> 01:27:00,318
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1451
01:27:02,387 --> 01:27:04,123
I... I've seen you two...

1452
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:07,860
Hi. Heh.

1453
01:27:11,597 --> 01:27:14,299
Wait. He's...
He's not <i>your</i> friend.

1454
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:29,982
Huh.

1455
01:27:30,116 --> 01:27:33,185
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1456
01:27:33,318 --> 01:27:35,721
I generally don't
go around advertising it.

1457
01:27:35,855 --> 01:27:38,524
Kind of defeats the whole
anonymous superhero thing.

1458
01:27:38,657 --> 01:27:40,358
- I said that.
- That's what he just said.

1459
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:55,741
My <i>lola's</i> asking if you could
clean up the webs you just shot.

1460
01:27:55,875 --> 01:27:57,543
- Oh, sorry, <i>Lola.</i>
- Yes, of course.

1461
01:27:57,676 --> 01:27:59,912
- I'm going to bed.
- Night, <i>Lola.</i>

1462
01:28:00,045 --> 01:28:01,847
Good night, Ned's <i>lola.</i>

1463
01:28:01,981 --> 01:28:04,750
Uh,
this might seem kind of weird,

1464
01:28:04,884 --> 01:28:06,719
but I've been trying
to find your friend

1465
01:28:06,852 --> 01:28:08,888
ever since I got here.

1466
01:28:09,021 --> 01:28:11,123
I just have this sense that...

1467
01:28:12,892 --> 01:28:14,126
That he needs my help.

1468
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:15,795
Our help.

1469
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:18,264
He does.

1470
01:28:18,396 --> 01:28:20,065
We don't know where he is.

1471
01:28:20,199 --> 01:28:25,604
And, um, honestly, right now
we're all he really has left.

1472
01:28:25,738 --> 01:28:30,743
Well, uh, is there some place
that he might go

1473
01:28:30,876 --> 01:28:33,279
that has meaning to him?

1474
01:28:34,513 --> 01:28:37,950
Like a place
where he would go to just...?

1475
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:40,019
Get away from everything?

1476
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:45,891
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1477
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:47,893
Empire State.

1478
01:28:48,027 --> 01:28:51,063
- It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1479
01:28:53,331 --> 01:28:55,134
Yes.

1480
01:28:55,267 --> 01:28:58,704
Yeah. I... I think I know
exactly where that would be.

1481
01:29:34,439 --> 01:29:35,774
I'm sorry.

1482
01:29:42,948 --> 01:29:44,449
Peter, there's...

1483
01:29:45,618 --> 01:29:47,519
There's some people here.

1484
01:29:48,654 --> 01:29:50,488
- What?
- Um...

1485
01:29:59,164 --> 01:30:01,000
Hey, wait, wait! Whoa!

1486
01:30:01,133 --> 01:30:02,201
What...?

1487
01:30:05,037 --> 01:30:06,071
Sorry...

1488
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:08,974
about May.

1489
01:30:12,611 --> 01:30:14,914
Yeah. Sorry.

1490
01:30:16,682 --> 01:30:18,684
I got some understanding
of what it is you're...

1491
01:30:18,817 --> 01:30:22,054
No, please don't tell me that
you know what I'm going through.

1492
01:30:22,187 --> 01:30:24,489
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1493
01:30:26,992 --> 01:30:28,394
And it's all my fault.

1494
01:30:32,564 --> 01:30:34,199
She died for nothing.

1495
01:30:37,770 --> 01:30:40,239
So I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

1496
01:30:40,372 --> 01:30:42,007
- Peter...
- Please don't.

1497
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,143
You don't belong here.

1498
01:30:44,276 --> 01:30:45,276
Either of you.

1499
01:30:45,344 --> 01:30:47,746
So I'm sending you home.

1500
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,849
Those other guys
are from your worlds, right?

1501
01:30:50,983 --> 01:30:52,418
So you deal with it.

1502
01:30:52,551 --> 01:30:55,187
If they die, if you kill them...

1503
01:30:55,321 --> 01:30:56,355
that's on you.

1504
01:30:57,488 --> 01:30:59,191
It's not my problem.

1505
01:30:59,325 --> 01:31:00,759
I don't care anymore.

1506
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:03,228
I'm done.

1507
01:31:07,833 --> 01:31:10,502
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1508
01:31:13,806 --> 01:31:15,774
But you have to go home now.

1509
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:19,244
Good luck.

1510
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,552
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1511
01:31:27,987 --> 01:31:29,355
It was my fault.

1512
01:31:30,589 --> 01:31:32,024
I lost...

1513
01:31:34,693 --> 01:31:36,729
I lost Gwen, my, um...

1514
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,798
She was my MJ.

1515
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,435
I couldn't save her.

1516
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:47,806
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1517
01:31:50,242 --> 01:31:52,578
But I carried on,
tried to, um...

1518
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:55,914
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being the, uh...

1519
01:31:57,383 --> 01:31:59,184
The friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man

1520
01:31:59,318 --> 01:32:02,187
'cause I know that's what
she would've wanted.

1521
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:05,991
But at some point, I just...
I stopped pulling my punches.

1522
01:32:09,595 --> 01:32:11,096
I got rageful.

1523
01:32:13,232 --> 01:32:14,600
I got bitter.

1524
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:17,469
I just don't want you

1525
01:32:17,603 --> 01:32:20,305
to end up like... Like me.

1526
01:32:21,774 --> 01:32:24,710
The night Ben died...

1527
01:32:24,843 --> 01:32:27,546
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1528
01:32:29,348 --> 01:32:31,116
I wanted him dead.

1529
01:32:33,585 --> 01:32:35,120
I got what I wanted.

1530
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:39,526
It didn't make it better.

1531
01:32:43,062 --> 01:32:45,532
It took me a long time...

1532
01:32:47,299 --> 01:32:49,701
to learn to get through
that darkness.

1533
01:32:52,304 --> 01:32:54,006
I wanna kill him.

1534
01:32:56,341 --> 01:32:58,310
I wanna tear him apart.

1535
01:33:01,914 --> 01:33:04,383
I can still hear
her voice in my head.

1536
01:33:09,254 --> 01:33:10,889
Even after she was hurt,

1537
01:33:11,023 --> 01:33:13,725
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1538
01:33:22,434 --> 01:33:24,203
She told me
that with great power...

1539
01:33:26,305 --> 01:33:28,140
Comes great responsibility.

1540
01:33:33,378 --> 01:33:34,880
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

1541
01:33:35,013 --> 01:33:36,516
Uncle Ben said it.

1542
01:33:36,648 --> 01:33:38,183
The day he died.

1543
01:33:42,821 --> 01:33:45,190
Maybe she didn't die
for nothing, Peter.

1544
01:33:54,933 --> 01:34:00,607
Okay, so, uh, Connors,
Marko, Dillon and, um...

1545
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:03,543
I think that I can repair the
devices for Dillon and Marko,

1546
01:34:03,675 --> 01:34:05,410
but the others...

1547
01:34:05,545 --> 01:34:08,780
Oh, I got Connors. I've cured
him once, so no big deal.

1548
01:34:10,415 --> 01:34:13,051
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1549
01:34:13,185 --> 01:34:14,786
Yeah, that's great.

1550
01:34:17,055 --> 01:34:20,893
I think I can make
an anti-serum for Dr. Osborn.

1551
01:34:21,026 --> 01:34:22,928
Been thinking about it
a long time.

1552
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:29,001
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1553
01:34:30,035 --> 01:34:31,170
Right.

1554
01:34:32,605 --> 01:34:34,273
That's what we do.

1555
01:34:42,314 --> 01:34:43,749
What?

1556
01:34:43,882 --> 01:34:45,317
Just three yous.

1557
01:35:00,899 --> 01:35:01,934
Um...

1558
01:35:03,468 --> 01:35:07,072
So do you have
a best friend too?

1559
01:35:08,941 --> 01:35:10,242
I did.

1560
01:35:11,944 --> 01:35:13,345
You did?

1561
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,583
He died in my arms...

1562
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,152
after he tried to kill me.

1563
01:35:21,787 --> 01:35:23,755
It was heartbreaking.

1564
01:35:25,457 --> 01:35:26,825
Dude.

1565
01:35:33,499 --> 01:35:35,934
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1566
01:35:36,068 --> 01:35:37,269
Yeah.

1567
01:35:46,512 --> 01:35:48,648
Hey, you okay?

1568
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,717
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1569
01:35:50,849 --> 01:35:52,150
Mm-hm.

1570
01:35:54,786 --> 01:35:57,489
You don't deserve this.

1571
01:35:57,624 --> 01:36:01,527
- I've ruined your life.
- No. No, no, no.

1572
01:36:01,661 --> 01:36:03,730
Look at me. I'm here.

1573
01:36:05,130 --> 01:36:06,599
Not going anywhere.

1574
01:36:07,899 --> 01:36:09,234
We're gonna get through this.

1575
01:36:09,368 --> 01:36:12,004
And we're gonna get
through it together.

1576
01:36:12,137 --> 01:36:13,405
Okay?

1577
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:17,209
Okay.

1578
01:36:21,547 --> 01:36:22,881
Thank you.

1579
01:36:34,026 --> 01:36:36,061
You have someone?

1580
01:36:36,194 --> 01:36:37,764
No.

1581
01:36:37,896 --> 01:36:42,801
Ah, I got no time for
Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1582
01:36:42,934 --> 01:36:44,403
Hm.

1583
01:36:44,537 --> 01:36:47,039
- Do you?
- Uh...

1584
01:36:47,172 --> 01:36:51,276
- that's a little complicated.
- Oh, I understand.

1585
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:53,879
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1586
01:36:54,012 --> 01:36:56,549
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1587
01:36:56,683 --> 01:36:59,552
Took a while
but we made it work.

1588
01:36:59,686 --> 01:37:01,253
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1589
01:37:01,386 --> 01:37:02,854
Me and...

1590
01:37:02,988 --> 01:37:04,189
MJ.

1591
01:37:05,558 --> 01:37:07,459
My MJ. Uh...

1592
01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:11,029
It gets confusing here.

1593
01:37:11,163 --> 01:37:12,297
Yeah.

1594
01:37:12,431 --> 01:37:14,399
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1595
01:37:14,534 --> 01:37:17,869
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1596
01:37:18,003 --> 01:37:19,772
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1597
01:37:19,905 --> 01:37:22,908
- Peter Parker?
- Again, we're all Peter Parker.

1598
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:25,645
- The computer.
- Oh!

1599
01:37:25,778 --> 01:37:27,379
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1600
01:37:27,513 --> 01:37:29,816
Okay, so now, all we gotta do

1601
01:37:29,948 --> 01:37:32,451
is lure these guys
some place, right?

1602
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:36,054
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1603
01:37:36,188 --> 01:37:37,657
and then send them home.

1604
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:40,392
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1605
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:43,629
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1606
01:37:43,763 --> 01:37:45,430
or do you got your suit?

1607
01:37:46,632 --> 01:37:48,768
- Good.
- Here's your web cartridges.

1608
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,336
- Oh, thanks, man.
- What's that for?

1609
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:54,774
Uh, it's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1610
01:37:54,906 --> 01:37:56,375
Whoa!

1611
01:37:57,610 --> 01:37:58,611
That came out of you.

1612
01:37:58,745 --> 01:38:00,646
Yeah. You can't do that, huh?

1613
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,981
- No.
- How on earth does that...?

1614
01:38:03,115 --> 01:38:05,818
We're getting sidetracked. This
is where we'll do this, okay?

1615
01:38:05,951 --> 01:38:08,353
It's isolated,
so no one should get hurt.

1616
01:38:08,487 --> 01:38:10,857
We draw them there with the box.
It's the thing they want.

1617
01:38:10,989 --> 01:38:13,058
All we have to do
is figure out how to get there.

1618
01:38:13,191 --> 01:38:14,560
- We could portal there.
- What?

1619
01:38:14,694 --> 01:38:17,062
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1620
01:38:17,195 --> 01:38:19,231
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1621
01:38:19,364 --> 01:38:21,199
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1622
01:38:21,333 --> 01:38:23,168
- No way.
- Yeah.

1623
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:25,571
I promise,
I won't turn into a supervillain

1624
01:38:25,705 --> 01:38:27,239
and try to kill you.

1625
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:30,909
Okay.

1626
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:32,678
Thank you.

1627
01:38:37,149 --> 01:38:39,418
Um, all right,
here goes nothing.

1628
01:38:39,552 --> 01:38:41,554
What's that thing
you always say?

1629
01:38:41,687 --> 01:38:45,257
- Expect disappointment and...
- No, no, no.

1630
01:38:45,390 --> 01:38:47,058
We're gonna kick some ass.

1631
01:38:47,192 --> 01:38:48,728
Okay.

1632
01:38:48,861 --> 01:38:51,363
Cure. Cure some ass.

1633
01:38:51,496 --> 01:38:53,265
Cure that ass.

1634
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:57,135
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1635
01:38:57,269 --> 01:38:59,237
<i>the</i> Bugle <i>tip line</i>

1636
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:02,307

1637
01:39:02,441 --> 01:39:05,511

1638
01:39:05,645 --> 01:39:07,179
<i>So, Peter Parker,</i>

1639
01:39:07,312 --> 01:39:09,715
<i>what pernicious propaganda
are you peddling?</i>

1640
01:39:09,849 --> 01:39:11,483
<i>- Just the truth.
- Oh, sure.</i>

1641
01:39:11,617 --> 01:39:14,085
<i>The truth is...</i>

1642
01:39:14,219 --> 01:39:16,421
<i>that this is all my fault.</i>

1643
01:39:16,556 --> 01:39:19,090
<i>I accidentally brought

1644
01:39:19,224 --> 01:39:20,827
Well, he admits it.

1645
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:22,929
<i>And if those people

1646
01:39:24,530 --> 01:39:27,600

1647

1649
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:36,107

1650
01:39:36,241 --> 01:39:38,043
<i>that everyone deserves

1651
01:39:38,176 --> 01:39:39,176
<i>That's why I'm here.</i>

1652
01:39:39,211 --> 01:39:41,112
And where is "here," exactly?

1653
01:39:43,014 --> 01:39:45,116
A place that represents
second chances.

1654
01:39:47,986 --> 01:39:50,690
<i>The Statue of Liberty?
Good God, folks.</i>

1655
01:39:50,823 --> 01:39:54,025
<i>He's about to destroy

1656
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,761

1657
01:39:55,895 --> 01:39:58,463
<i>Believe me,
the world is watching.</i>

1658
01:39:58,598 --> 01:40:00,098
wish me luck.

1659
01:40:01,601 --> 01:40:03,836
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1660
01:40:10,308 --> 01:40:12,410
Okay, guys,
it could be any minute now.

1661
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:14,814
Yep, almost done.

1662
01:40:19,652 --> 01:40:24,189
You know, Max was like
the sweetest guy ever

1663
01:40:24,322 --> 01:40:28,794
before he fell into...
a pool of electric eels.

1664
01:40:28,928 --> 01:40:30,596
That'll do it.

1665
01:40:31,931 --> 01:40:34,000
Mm. Oh, there it goes.

1666
01:40:35,267 --> 01:40:37,135
Heh, you okay?

1667
01:40:37,269 --> 01:40:39,037
Oh, it's my back.

1668
01:40:39,170 --> 01:40:42,440
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1669
01:40:42,575 --> 01:40:44,442
Yeah. No, I got
a middle back thing too.

1670
01:40:44,577 --> 01:40:47,947
- Really?
- Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1671
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:49,381
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1672
01:40:49,515 --> 01:40:51,182
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- All right.

1673
01:40:52,585 --> 01:40:53,786
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1674
01:40:57,023 --> 01:40:59,224
Yep. That's good.

1675
01:40:59,357 --> 01:41:02,528
- How is it?
- Wow.

1676
01:41:02,662 --> 01:41:05,031
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1677
01:41:05,163 --> 01:41:06,197
Wow.

1678
01:41:09,467 --> 01:41:12,370
This is so cool.
I always wanted brothers.

1679
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:16,943
So you, like, make your own
web fluid in your body?

1680
01:41:17,075 --> 01:41:18,711
I'd rather not talk about this.

1681
01:41:18,844 --> 01:41:20,780
- I don't mean to...
- But are you teasing me?

1682
01:41:20,913 --> 01:41:22,280
No, no.
He's not teasing you.

1683
01:41:22,414 --> 01:41:24,684
It's just that we can't do that,

1684
01:41:24,817 --> 01:41:28,219
so we're curious as to how your
web situation works, that's all.

1685
01:41:28,353 --> 01:41:31,023
If it's personal, I don't wanna
pry, but I think it's cool.

1686
01:41:31,156 --> 01:41:34,192
I... I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1687
01:41:34,326 --> 01:41:36,662
Like I don't...
Like I don't <i>do</i> breathing.

1688
01:41:36,796 --> 01:41:38,664
- Like, breathing just happens.
- Whoa.

1689
01:41:38,798 --> 01:41:40,533
Does it just come out
of your wrists,

1690
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:43,069
or does it come out
of anywhere else?

1691
01:41:43,201 --> 01:41:45,370
Only... Only the wrists.

1692
01:41:45,504 --> 01:41:47,673
Never had a block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1693
01:41:47,807 --> 01:41:50,241
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's...

1694
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:52,511
It's a hassle compared
to what you got.

1695
01:41:52,645 --> 01:41:54,046
Sounds like a hassle.
But I did.

1696
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:55,413
You said that, I was like,

1697
01:41:55,548 --> 01:41:58,149
- "Oh, I had a web block."
- Whoa. Why?

1698
01:41:58,283 --> 01:41:59,919
Existential crisis stuff.

1699
01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:01,486
Yeah.
Don't get me started on that.

1700
01:42:01,621 --> 01:42:04,690
Hey. What are, like,
some of the craziest villains

1701
01:42:04,824 --> 01:42:07,201
- that you guys have fought?
- Seems you've met some of them.

1702
01:42:07,225 --> 01:42:08,794
Heh-heh, that's a good question.

1703
01:42:08,928 --> 01:42:14,232
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1704
01:42:14,366 --> 01:42:16,434
Oh, no way.
I fought an alien too.

1705
01:42:16,569 --> 01:42:18,236
- On Earth and in space.
- Oh.

1706
01:42:18,370 --> 01:42:20,106
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1707
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:24,777
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1708
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:27,580
I'm lame compared...
I fought a Russian guy

1709
01:42:27,713 --> 01:42:29,081
in a rhinoceros machine.

1710
01:42:29,214 --> 01:42:31,884
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1711
01:42:32,018 --> 01:42:34,319
- 'Cause you are not.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

1712
01:42:34,452 --> 01:42:36,656
- I'm not saying I am...
- But it's just the self-talk.

1713
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:38,624
- Maybe we should...
- Listen, I...

1714
01:42:38,758 --> 01:42:40,225
'Cause you're amazing.

1715
01:42:40,358 --> 01:42:42,227
Just to take it in for a minute.

1716
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,797
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You... You are amazing.

1717
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:46,599
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing.

1718
01:42:46,732 --> 01:42:48,433
- Will you say it?
- I needed to hear that.

1719
01:42:48,567 --> 01:42:50,102
Thank you.

1720
01:42:50,235 --> 01:42:52,605
All right, guys, focus up.
You feel that?

1721
01:42:52,738 --> 01:42:54,006
Yeah.

1722
01:43:01,147 --> 01:43:03,082
What's up, Peter?

1723
01:43:05,383 --> 01:43:07,787
How you like the new-new?

1724
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,757
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1725
01:43:13,258 --> 01:43:15,094
But I'll let you live.

1726
01:43:15,226 --> 01:43:17,596
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1727
01:43:19,632 --> 01:43:21,667
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1728
01:43:28,107 --> 01:43:30,943
Hey, Max, I missed you, man. Ho!

1729
01:43:33,546 --> 01:43:35,981
All right, MJ, heads up!

1730
01:43:36,115 --> 01:43:38,249
Got it! Close it.

1731
01:43:40,385 --> 01:43:42,154
Uh, Ned, it's not closing.

1732
01:43:42,287 --> 01:43:43,421
Yeah, I know.

1733
01:43:43,556 --> 01:43:45,157
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1734
01:43:45,290 --> 01:43:48,326
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1735
01:43:57,169 --> 01:43:59,538
Max, Max, Max.
Can we talk for a second?

1736
01:43:59,672 --> 01:44:02,340
- Just you and me, just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1737
01:44:02,474 --> 01:44:04,610
- My old friend Spider-Man.
- I'm trying to save you.

1738
01:44:04,744 --> 01:44:07,022
- That's all I've ever wanted.
- You're not trying to save me.

1739
01:44:07,046 --> 01:44:09,314
- I am.
- You ain't even the shit no more.

1740
01:44:09,447 --> 01:44:11,150
- Oh...
- Don't worry about me.

1741
01:44:11,282 --> 01:44:13,318
I'll save myself.

1742
01:44:13,451 --> 01:44:16,055
- Burn up!
- Aah! Whoa!

1743
01:44:16,188 --> 01:44:17,823
Well, I got his attention.
Now what?

1744
01:44:17,957 --> 01:44:19,390
Okay, great.

1745
01:44:19,525 --> 01:44:23,495
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1746
01:44:24,964 --> 01:44:27,199
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1747
01:44:27,332 --> 01:44:28,768
<i>I need Max's cure.</i>

1748
01:44:28,901 --> 01:44:31,003
Yeah. I'm on it.

1749
01:44:31,137 --> 01:44:32,505
<i>I need the Lizard cure.</i>

1750
01:44:32,638 --> 01:44:34,840
Uh, okay, okay.

1751
01:44:39,845 --> 01:44:41,514
Where's the box, Peter?

1752
01:44:41,647 --> 01:44:43,883
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care!

1753
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:56,962
Sorry!

1754
01:44:58,197 --> 01:44:59,265
Gross!

1755
01:44:59,397 --> 01:45:00,766
Sad to tell you, Sandman,

1756
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:02,601
nobody's going home.

1757
01:45:41,006 --> 01:45:42,775
What the hell
is going on out there?

1758
01:45:42,908 --> 01:45:44,610
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1759
01:45:44,743 --> 01:45:47,880
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1760
01:45:48,013 --> 01:45:50,216
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1761
01:45:50,348 --> 01:45:52,151
We're clearly
not very good at this.

1762
01:45:52,284 --> 01:45:53,384
I know, I know. We suck.

1763
01:45:53,519 --> 01:45:55,221
I don't know
how to work as a team.

1764
01:45:55,353 --> 01:45:58,157
- Me neither.
- I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1765
01:45:58,290 --> 01:45:59,825
I don't wanna brag, but I will.

1766
01:45:59,959 --> 01:46:00,959
I was in the Avengers.

1767
01:46:01,026 --> 01:46:02,294
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1768
01:46:02,427 --> 01:46:03,629
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1769
01:46:03,762 --> 01:46:05,631
What is that?

1770
01:46:05,764 --> 01:46:07,733
- You don't have the Avengers?
- Is that a band?

1771
01:46:07,867 --> 01:46:10,302
- Are you in a band?
- No, I'm not in a band.

1772
01:46:10,435 --> 01:46:11,971
The Avengers is
Earth's mightiest...

1773
01:46:12,104 --> 01:46:13,806
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1774
01:46:13,939 --> 01:46:15,708
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle

1775
01:46:15,841 --> 01:46:17,209
and coordinate our attacks.

1776
01:46:17,343 --> 01:46:18,777
Yes. Okay.

1777
01:46:18,911 --> 01:46:20,779
- Let's pick one target.
- Right.

1778
01:46:20,913 --> 01:46:22,513
We take them off the board
one at a time.

1779
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:25,117
- You got it. Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1780
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:26,484
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1781
01:46:26,619 --> 01:46:29,221
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

1782
01:46:29,355 --> 01:46:31,023
I love you guys.

1783
01:46:33,424 --> 01:46:34,793
Thank you.

1784
01:46:36,161 --> 01:46:38,330
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1785
01:46:44,136 --> 01:46:45,871
Yes!

1786
01:47:07,626 --> 01:47:09,561
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1787
01:47:09,695 --> 01:47:11,664
Sandman's first.

1788
01:47:11,797 --> 01:47:13,866
I'm gonna lead him
inside the statue.

1789
01:47:13,999 --> 01:47:16,502
I'll meet you at the top.

1790
01:47:18,137 --> 01:47:19,905
- Come on!
- Hey!

1791
01:47:22,942 --> 01:47:25,911
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1792
01:47:27,112 --> 01:47:29,348
- Peter 1!
- I got it!

1793
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,494
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1794
01:47:45,496 --> 01:47:47,099
Guys, I'm at the top.

1795
01:47:47,232 --> 01:47:48,567
I need the cure!

1796
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:52,905
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1797
01:47:54,472 --> 01:47:58,243
Just wait your turn, doc!

1798
01:47:58,377 --> 01:48:00,245
I'll be right back.

1799
01:48:36,749 --> 01:48:38,017
It's okay, Flint.

1800
01:48:40,219 --> 01:48:42,488
We're gonna get you home.

1801
01:48:42,621 --> 01:48:45,024
You just stay right here.

1802
01:48:49,661 --> 01:48:50,696
How do we stop him?

1803
01:48:50,829 --> 01:48:52,040
I've never seen him
this powerful.

1804
01:48:52,064 --> 01:48:52,931
It's the arc reactor.

1805
01:48:53,065 --> 01:48:54,133
We gotta get it off him.

1806
01:48:54,266 --> 01:48:56,201
You're not gonna
take this from me.

1807
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:00,439
That's not gonna work.

1808
01:49:04,943 --> 01:49:06,513
We gotta do this up close.

1809
01:49:06,645 --> 01:49:08,380
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left.

1810
01:49:08,515 --> 01:49:09,548
On me. Unh!

1811
01:49:13,252 --> 01:49:15,721
Yeah!

1812
01:49:37,076 --> 01:49:40,179
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1813
01:49:40,312 --> 01:49:43,115
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1814
01:49:43,248 --> 01:49:45,126
- All right, we got this.
- Focus and close the portal.

1815
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:46,385
Close it.

1816
01:49:49,655 --> 01:49:51,356
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1817
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:54,059
And that is a lizard,
and we should go!

1818
01:49:58,664 --> 01:50:00,365
Run!

1819
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,901
Come on! Come on, this way.
Quick, quick, quick!

1820
01:50:03,035 --> 01:50:04,303
Connors, stop!

1821
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,880
Yeah.

1822
01:50:27,259 --> 01:50:29,728
Leave them. They're mine.

1823
01:50:29,862 --> 01:50:32,397
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1824
01:50:32,532 --> 01:50:34,766
Dr. Octavius, no.

1825
01:50:37,269 --> 01:50:39,071
What are you doing?

1826
01:50:40,372 --> 01:50:41,640
Get it off of me.

1827
01:50:52,552 --> 01:50:53,752
There you go.

1828
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:13,805
MJ!

1829
01:51:24,617 --> 01:51:26,051
Whoa.

1830
01:51:26,185 --> 01:51:27,986
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1831
01:51:32,191 --> 01:51:34,126
- Nice, Ned!
- Oh, yeah!

1832
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:37,229
Oh.

1833
01:51:37,362 --> 01:51:38,362
Where is he?

1834
01:51:38,463 --> 01:51:39,965
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1835
01:51:40,098 --> 01:51:41,418
Before you do anything, Mister...

1836
01:51:41,534 --> 01:51:44,102
Doctor Strange, sir,
Peter's plan is working.

1837
01:51:44,236 --> 01:51:46,405
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1838
01:51:54,980 --> 01:51:56,181
Dr. Connors?

1839
01:51:59,552 --> 01:52:01,119
Welcome back, sir.

1840
01:52:02,754 --> 01:52:04,456
Well, I'll be damned.

1841
01:52:06,959 --> 01:52:09,461
Did you just open a portal?

1842
01:52:09,596 --> 01:52:11,363
Yes... Yes, sir, I did.

1843
01:52:11,496 --> 01:52:12,864
Hmm.

1844
01:52:18,504 --> 01:52:22,274
Max?

1845
01:52:22,407 --> 01:52:25,545
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1846
01:52:27,446 --> 01:52:29,181
Back to being a nobody.

1847
01:52:29,314 --> 01:52:32,552
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was. Yes, I was.

1848
01:52:32,685 --> 01:52:33,752
You didn't see me.

1849
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,155
Can I tell you something,
though?

1850
01:52:37,289 --> 01:52:38,890
Yeah.

1851
01:52:39,024 --> 01:52:41,527
You got a nice face.
You're just a kid.

1852
01:52:41,661 --> 01:52:44,429
- Ehh...
- You're from Queens.

1853
01:52:44,564 --> 01:52:47,833
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1854
01:52:47,966 --> 01:52:50,869
I just thought
you was gonna be Black.

1855
01:52:51,003 --> 01:52:53,338
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't apologize.

1856
01:52:53,472 --> 01:52:56,842
There's gotta be a Black
Spider-Man somewhere out there.

1857
01:52:59,344 --> 01:53:01,079
Goddamn eels.

1858
01:53:04,316 --> 01:53:06,184
The power of the sun.

1859
01:53:08,987 --> 01:53:11,089
In the palm of your hand.

1860
01:53:11,223 --> 01:53:12,692
Peter?

1861
01:53:14,326 --> 01:53:15,728
Otto.

1862
01:53:17,095 --> 01:53:19,699
Oh, it's good to see you,
dear boy.

1863
01:53:19,831 --> 01:53:21,800
It's good to see you.

1864
01:53:21,933 --> 01:53:23,468
You're all grown up.

1865
01:53:24,903 --> 01:53:26,038
How are you?

1866
01:53:28,240 --> 01:53:29,374
Trying to do better.

1867
01:53:36,716 --> 01:53:38,551
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1868
01:53:38,685 --> 01:53:41,420
I've been dangling over
the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1869
01:53:41,554 --> 01:53:44,590
I know, I know, I know.
I, uh... Um... Uh...

1870
01:53:44,724 --> 01:53:47,259
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I mean...

1871
01:53:47,392 --> 01:53:50,362
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1872
01:53:50,495 --> 01:53:52,598
It's okay.
Uh, these are my new friends.

1873
01:53:52,732 --> 01:53:55,052
This is Peter Parker, Peter
Parker. Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1874
01:53:55,167 --> 01:53:56,569
They're mes
from other universes.

1875
01:53:56,703 --> 01:53:58,012
- No, no, no.
- They're here to help.

1876
01:53:58,036 --> 01:53:59,147
He's the wizard
I told you about.

1877
01:53:59,171 --> 01:54:00,872
Look, I am really impressed

1878
01:54:01,006 --> 01:54:04,142
that you've managed to give them
all a second chance, kid.

1879
01:54:04,276 --> 01:54:06,411
But this has to end. Now.

1880
01:54:06,546 --> 01:54:09,981
Can the Spider-Man
come out to play?

1881
01:54:31,838 --> 01:54:33,506
Strange, no!

1882
01:55:02,334 --> 01:55:03,636
Are you okay?

1883
01:55:04,637 --> 01:55:06,037
Yeah.

1884
01:55:06,171 --> 01:55:07,472
I'm okay.

1885
01:55:09,776 --> 01:55:10,976
Are you okay?

1886
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,194
Whoa!

1887
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:30,422
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1888
01:56:33,325 --> 01:56:34,527
Ned?

1889
01:56:35,528 --> 01:56:36,929
- Ned!
- Hey!

1890
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:43,268
- MJ!
- Peter?

1891
01:56:43,401 --> 01:56:45,972
- Ned!
- Peter!

1892
01:56:46,104 --> 01:56:47,239
Hey!

1893
01:56:47,372 --> 01:56:49,474
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1894
01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:05,457
Poor Peter.

1895
01:57:05,591 --> 01:57:09,695
Too weak to send me home to die.

1896
01:57:09,829 --> 01:57:11,329
No.

1897
01:57:11,463 --> 01:57:13,966
I just wanna kill you myself.

1898
01:57:14,099 --> 01:57:15,835
Attaboy.

1899
01:59:05,276 --> 01:59:09,582
She was there because of you.

1900
01:59:09,715 --> 01:59:13,786
I may have struck the blow,
but you...

1901
01:59:16,555 --> 01:59:20,993
Ha-ha, you are the one
that killed her.

1902
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:49,622
Peter.

1903
02:00:02,367 --> 02:00:03,636
What have I done?

1904
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:09,340
- It's you.
- You okay?

1905
02:00:09,474 --> 02:00:12,611
Uh, yeah, I'm good.
I've been stabbed before.

1906
02:00:12,745 --> 02:00:14,312
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1907
02:00:14,446 --> 02:00:16,916
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1908
02:00:17,983 --> 02:00:21,352
Nice throw.

1909
02:00:21,486 --> 02:00:24,322
What? Is that happening,
or am I dying?

1910
02:00:24,456 --> 02:00:25,856
Yeah, that's happening.
That's real.

1911
02:00:25,958 --> 02:00:27,793
Are there people in the sky?

1912
02:00:36,434 --> 02:00:38,771
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1913
02:00:43,175 --> 02:00:44,409
What's happening?

1914
02:00:44,543 --> 02:00:46,712
They're coming through.
I can't stop them.

1915
02:00:46,846 --> 02:00:48,355
There's gotta be
something we could do.

1916
02:00:48,379 --> 02:00:49,849
Can't you just
cast the spell again?

1917
02:00:49,982 --> 02:00:52,218
The original way,
before I screwed it up.

1918
02:00:52,350 --> 02:00:54,486
We're too late for that.
They're here.

1919
02:00:54,620 --> 02:00:56,722
They're here because of you.

1920
02:01:02,027 --> 02:01:03,596
What if everyone
forgot who I was?

1921
02:01:03,729 --> 02:01:04,830
What?

1922
02:01:04,964 --> 02:01:06,364
They're coming
because of me, right?

1923
02:01:06,499 --> 02:01:09,735
Because I'm Peter Parker?
So cast a new spell.

1924
02:01:09,869 --> 02:01:12,238
But this time, make everyone
forget who Peter Parker is.

1925
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:14,106
Make everyone forget...

1926
02:01:15,708 --> 02:01:17,076
- me.
- No.

1927
02:01:17,209 --> 02:01:21,279
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1928
02:01:21,412 --> 02:01:24,016
But you gotta understand,
that would mean that everyone

1929
02:01:24,150 --> 02:01:27,052
who knows and loves you, we...

1930
02:01:28,821 --> 02:01:30,956
We'd have no memory of you.

1931
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:34,794
It would be as though
you never existed.

1932
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:39,231
I know.

1933
02:01:40,533 --> 02:01:41,901
Do it.

1934
02:01:45,504 --> 02:01:48,607
You better go and say your
goodbyes. You don't have long.

1935
02:01:48,741 --> 02:01:50,910
- Thank you, sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1936
02:01:54,246 --> 02:01:55,346
Thank you, Stephen.

1937
02:01:57,415 --> 02:02:00,286
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1938
02:02:02,888 --> 02:02:04,123
I'll see you around.

1939
02:02:06,025 --> 02:02:07,560
So long, kid.

1940
02:02:14,834 --> 02:02:17,703
Hey. Uh, I think this is it.

1941
02:02:17,837 --> 02:02:20,072
- I think you're about to go home.
- Okay.

1942
02:02:20,206 --> 02:02:23,142
- All right.
- Um, look, I, uh...

1943
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:26,444
Thank you.

1944
02:02:26,579 --> 02:02:30,282
I just wanna... I want you to...
I wanna tell you that...

1945
02:02:30,415 --> 02:02:32,318
I don't know how to say this.

1946
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:34,220
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1947
02:02:35,855 --> 02:02:38,423
You know. It's what we do.

1948
02:02:40,226 --> 02:02:42,928
Yeah, it's what we do. Um...

1949
02:02:43,062 --> 02:02:46,832
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ.
I, uh...

1950
02:02:46,966 --> 02:02:49,168
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1951
02:02:53,471 --> 02:02:55,941
- I guess I'll see you.
- See you.

1952
02:02:56,075 --> 02:02:57,710
Bye.

1953
02:02:59,645 --> 02:03:01,479
- Oh...
- You're in so much pain, huh?

1954
02:03:01,614 --> 02:03:02,681
- I am.
- Yeah.

1955
02:03:06,685 --> 02:03:08,721
Oh, you're okay. Oh!

1956
02:03:08,854 --> 02:03:11,724
Yeah, you did.
So proud of you.

1957
02:03:11,857 --> 02:03:14,727
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1958
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:16,900
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1959
02:03:17,029 --> 02:03:18,864
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1960
02:03:18,998 --> 02:03:20,332
- Okay, okay.
- I promise.

1961
02:03:20,465 --> 02:03:22,400
Good.

1962
02:03:22,534 --> 02:03:25,070
Um, we should go, right?

1963
02:03:27,606 --> 02:03:30,408
Yeah. You're gonna forget
who I am.

1964
02:03:32,344 --> 02:03:33,712
- What?
- Forget who you are?

1965
02:03:33,846 --> 02:03:35,915
What are you talking about?

1966
02:03:36,048 --> 02:03:38,817
It's okay.
I'm gonna come and find you,

1967
02:03:38,951 --> 02:03:40,819
and I'll explain everything.

1968
02:03:42,655 --> 02:03:45,391
I'll make you remember me.

1969
02:03:45,524 --> 02:03:48,227
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1970
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,530
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1971
02:03:51,664 --> 02:03:54,667
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1972
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:57,636
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1973
02:03:57,770 --> 02:04:01,340
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1974
02:04:01,472 --> 02:04:03,809
There's always
something we can do.

1975
02:04:04,944 --> 02:04:06,745
There's nothing we can do.

1976
02:04:10,783 --> 02:04:12,384
But it'll be okay.

1977
02:04:16,221 --> 02:04:17,256
You promise?

1978
02:04:20,359 --> 02:04:21,894
Yeah, I promise.

1979
02:04:33,072 --> 02:04:35,074
I'll come find you, okay?

1980
02:04:35,207 --> 02:04:36,875
I know you will.

1981
02:04:37,977 --> 02:04:39,511
- Okay.
- Okay.

1982
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:42,848
You better.

1983
02:04:44,683 --> 02:04:46,618
If you don't,
I'll just figure it out.

1984
02:04:46,752 --> 02:04:49,221
I've done it before,
I can do it again.

1985
02:04:50,222 --> 02:04:52,091
I promise I'll fix this.

1986
02:04:53,192 --> 02:04:54,793
I really hate magic.

1987
02:04:56,095 --> 02:04:57,596
Yeah. Me too.

1988
02:05:01,934 --> 02:05:03,068
I love you.

1989
02:05:09,408 --> 02:05:11,844
- I love...
- Just wait.

1990
02:05:11,977 --> 02:05:14,480
Wait and tell me
when you see me again.

1991
02:05:16,415 --> 02:05:17,783
Sure.

1992
02:06:44,937 --> 02:06:46,472
<i>I love you.</i>

1993
02:07:24,743 --> 02:07:26,912
<i>It's been a few
weeks since the fiasco</i>

1994
02:07:27,045 --> 02:07:29,582
on the Statue of Liberty,
and Spider-Man's cultists

1995
02:07:29,715 --> 02:07:34,419
continue to contend that
the vile vigilante is a hero.

1996
02:07:34,554 --> 02:07:36,589
Well, if he were a hero,
he'd unmask himself

1997
02:07:36,722 --> 02:07:38,657
and tell us who he really is,

1998
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:42,261
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

1999
02:07:42,394 --> 02:07:45,497
Only a coward hides
his true intentions.

2000
02:07:45,632 --> 02:07:47,833

2001

2003
02:07:52,137 --> 02:07:57,109
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I, uh...

2004
02:07:58,578 --> 02:07:59,912
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,

2005
02:08:00,045 --> 02:08:01,980
and you don't know me, but you...

2006
02:08:04,917 --> 02:08:06,785
Okay, come on.

2007
02:08:08,387 --> 02:08:09,955
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

2008
02:08:19,798 --> 02:08:21,133
Hey.

2009
02:08:26,238 --> 02:08:28,641
One sec. Can I help you?

2010
02:08:28,774 --> 02:08:33,178
Hi. Um, my name
is Peter Parker, and I...

2011
02:08:36,815 --> 02:08:40,152
would like a coffee, please.

2012
02:08:40,285 --> 02:08:42,354
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

2013
02:08:49,629 --> 02:08:51,463
Doughnut for my fellow Engineer.

2014
02:08:51,598 --> 02:08:53,465
Oh! Wait, what?

2015
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:55,367
MIT, they're the Engineers.
The mascot.

2016
02:08:55,501 --> 02:08:58,003
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

2017
02:08:58,136 --> 02:09:00,172
Look at you
with the school spirit.

2018
02:09:00,305 --> 02:09:02,040
Tell anybody, I will deny it.

2019
02:09:02,174 --> 02:09:03,875
Oh, okay.

2020
02:09:13,519 --> 02:09:16,355
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

2021
02:09:16,488 --> 02:09:17,590
Your coffee.

2022
02:09:17,724 --> 02:09:19,224
- Right. Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

2023
02:09:19,358 --> 02:09:20,560
Um...

2024
02:09:22,127 --> 02:09:24,196
Are you excited for MIT?

2025
02:09:25,163 --> 02:09:27,232
Oh, uh, right. Yeah.

2026
02:09:27,366 --> 02:09:30,737
Uh, yeah. Actually,
I am excited, which is weird,

2027
02:09:30,869 --> 02:09:33,171
'cause I don't really
get excited about things.

2028
02:09:33,305 --> 02:09:34,906
I kind of expect disappointment.

2029
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:38,110
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

2030
02:09:38,243 --> 02:09:40,212
Right?

2031
02:09:40,345 --> 02:09:41,947
Uh...

2032
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:43,915
yeah. Right.

2033
02:09:45,317 --> 02:09:47,352
I don't know, it kind of
feels different

2034
02:09:47,486 --> 02:09:49,288
this time for some reason.

2035
02:10:00,032 --> 02:10:01,433
Right. Um...

2036
02:10:02,669 --> 02:10:04,970
What I was...

2037
02:10:13,513 --> 02:10:15,615
You okay?

2038
02:10:15,748 --> 02:10:17,883
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

2039
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:30,797
Is there anything else?

2040
02:10:43,075 --> 02:10:44,309
No.

2041
02:10:47,879 --> 02:10:49,749
Thank you.

2042
02:10:49,881 --> 02:10:51,283
No problem.

2043
02:10:57,389 --> 02:10:59,726
I'll, uh, see you around.

2044
02:12:03,856 --> 02:12:05,424
How'd you know her?

2045
02:12:08,895 --> 02:12:10,962
Through Spider-Man.

2046
02:12:11,096 --> 02:12:12,096
You?

2047
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:13,499
Same.

2048
02:12:18,838 --> 02:12:21,306
I lost a good friend
a while back.

2049
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,974
Felt like this.

2050
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:27,880
It hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

2051
02:12:28,013 --> 02:12:29,882
because you remember
what they stood for

2052
02:12:30,015 --> 02:12:33,185
and you wonder,
"Is all that gone too?"

2053
02:12:37,523 --> 02:12:39,191
No, it's not gone.

2054
02:12:41,794 --> 02:12:43,763
Everyone that she helped...

2055
02:12:45,865 --> 02:12:48,200
they'll keep it going.

2056
02:12:48,333 --> 02:12:49,869
You really think so?

2057
02:12:50,903 --> 02:12:51,938
I know it.

2058
02:12:54,072 --> 02:12:57,543
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

2059
02:13:04,884 --> 02:13:08,855
Rent is due on the
first of the month. Don't be late.

02:17:30,716 --> 02:17:32,151
superpeople.

2138
02:17:38,958 --> 02:17:40,226
There was a billionaire,

2139
02:17:40,358 --> 02:17:42,828
he had a tin suit
and he could fly, right?

2140
02:17:45,164 --> 02:17:48,100
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2141
02:17:48,234 --> 02:17:50,169
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

2142
02:17:50,301 --> 02:17:52,221
<i>And you thought Lethal
Protector was a shit name.</i>

2143
02:17:52,337 --> 02:17:54,339
Yeah, because it is.

2144
02:17:54,472 --> 02:17:55,708
Now tell me again

2145
02:17:55,841 --> 02:17:58,744
about your purple alien
that loves stones.

2146
02:17:58,878 --> 02:18:01,514
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2147
02:18:01,647 --> 02:18:03,582
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- They don't.

2148
02:18:03,716 --> 02:18:05,684
Know what aliens love?
Eating brains.

2149
02:18:05,818 --> 02:18:07,920
Because that's what they do.
All right?

2150
02:18:08,053 --> 02:18:10,723
Señor, he made
my family disappear.

2151
02:18:12,091 --> 02:18:13,192
For five years.

2152
02:18:14,527 --> 02:18:15,594
Five years?

2153
02:18:17,863 --> 02:18:19,031
That's a long time.

2154
02:18:21,432 --> 02:18:22,935
Maybe I...

2155
02:18:23,068 --> 02:18:25,871
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2156
02:18:27,372 --> 02:18:28,372
Spider-Man.

2157
02:18:28,473 --> 02:18:31,544
<i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

2158
02:18:32,912 --> 02:18:34,180
<i>Let's go skinny-dip!</i>

2159
02:18:34,312 --> 02:18:35,748
I don't think
we should skinny-dip.

2160
02:18:35,881 --> 02:18:37,683
You have to pay the bill.

2161
02:18:37,817 --> 02:18:39,185
<i>What is happening? No!</i>

2162
02:18:39,317 --> 02:18:41,620
<i>No, we just got here!
No, not again!</i>

2163
02:18:46,258 --> 02:18:48,027
And there he goes.

2164
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:51,096
Without paying the bill,
no tips, nothing.

2165
02:26:01,561 --> 02:26:03,529
<i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

2166
02:26:03,663 --> 02:26:05,665
<i>- It's too dangerous.
- Why?</i>

2167
02:26:05,797 --> 02:26:09,067
<i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

2168
02:26:09,201 --> 02:26:11,069
<i>The multiverse is a concept</i>

2169
02:26:11,203 --> 02:26:14,206
<i>about which we know
frighteningly little.</i>

2170
02:26:16,141 --> 02:26:18,076
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

2171
02:26:19,378 --> 02:26:20,747
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

2172
02:26:26,653 --> 02:26:28,253
<i>It was the only way.</i>

2173
02:26:33,191 --> 02:26:37,630
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

2174
02:26:56,549 --> 02:26:57,583
Wanda.

2175
02:26:59,686 --> 02:27:02,220
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

2176
02:27:02,354 --> 02:27:06,058
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt.

2177
02:27:06,191 --> 02:27:08,561
I'm not here to talk
about Westview.

2178
02:27:09,529 --> 02:27:10,763
Then what are you here for?

2179
02:27:10,896 --> 02:27:11,930
We need your help.

2180
02:27:13,365 --> 02:27:14,600
With what?

2181
02:27:14,734 --> 02:27:16,368
What do you know
about the multiverse?

2182
02:27:25,210 --> 02:27:26,411
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2183
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:31,149
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

2184
02:27:33,786 --> 02:27:35,555
<i>the greatest threat...</i>

2185
02:27:36,756 --> 02:27:38,156
<i>to our universe...</i>

2186
02:27:46,632 --> 02:27:47,834
<i>is you.</i>

2187
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:53,338
Things just got out of hand.
